The country, which has a population of 10 million, has recorded 609,000 cases and 9,920 deaths as of Jan. 22, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. \n\nThis is the second time that the bishops have suspended public worship. The first was in March 2020, when the pandemic arrived in the country located on the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain. The restrictions were eased at the end of May.\n\nThe bishops said that public Masses would be suspended from Jan. 23 -- the day before the country's presidential election -- along with catechesis and other pastoral activities that required people to gather. They called on priests to offer livestreamed Masses. \n\nThe bishops had called for the suspension or postponement of baptisms, confirmations, and marriages earlier this month.\n\nThey said that funerals could be celebrated according to norms issued in May last year, which require mourners to maintain a social distance.\n\nA Lenten retreat for the bishops, scheduled for Feb. 22-26, has also been canceled.\n\nThe Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which has been hit hard financially by the pandemic, will broadcast three Masses and two rosary prayers daily while public Masses are suspended. \n\nThe Masses, which will be transmitted via the shrine's website, will take place at 11 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. local time. The rosary will be recited at 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. local time.\n\nShrine rector Fr. Carlos Cabecinhas said: \"We know that it is not the same to be physically present or to be able to follow on television, but that is the one possible way we have to participate now and therefore we want to be present with you through this difficult moment.\"",

    "content": "The lives of LGBTQ+ people in Afghanistan have “dramatically worsened” under Taliban rule, according to a new survey, which highlights cases of violence, gang-rape and death threats since the group seized power last year.\n\nThe report, by Human Rights Watch (HRW), recorded nearly 60 cases of targeted violence against LGBTQ+ people since August 2021, many of whom described how Taliban rule has destroyed their lives.\n\n“Things were always rough,” said Heather Barr, associate director of the women’s rights division at HRW. “But people had found ways to survive and build community and support each other, and they had hope that things were gradually improving. On 15 August, all of that ended.”\n\nHomosexuality was banned under Ashraf Ghani, the ousted president of Afghanistan, and punishable with prison. However, the HRW report said that the Taliban “vowed to take a hard line against the rights of LGBT people” and cited sharia law.\n\n“We spoke with LGBT Afghans who have survived gang-rape, mob attacks, or have been hunted by their own family members who joined the Taliban, and they have no hope that state institutions will protect them,” said J Lester Feder, senior fellow for emergency research at OutRight Action International, who contributed to the report. “For those LGBT people who want to flee the country, there are few good options; most of Afghanistan’s neighbours also criminalise same-sex relations. It is difficult to overstate how devastating – and terrifying – the return of Taliban rule has been for LGBT Afghans.”\n\nZeba Gul*, 16, described to the Guardian how her life had worsened in the last few months. “I like to wear makeup, I like dresses, and I love to dance. But my family didn’t allow all that,” the teenager told the Guardian. “They would lock me up with chains and beat me. They would shave my head, tear my clothes and swear at me, calling me ezaak [a derogatory term for homosexuals].”\n\nGul described the horrors of growing up as a transperson in a deeply conservative country like Afghanistan.\n\nThe Rahmati family living in slum conditions in Herat, Afghanistan.\n‘I’ve already sold my daughters; now, my kidney’: winter in Afghanistan’s slums\nRead more\nBefore the Taliban came to her town in western Afghanistan, she was tormented as an object of shame by her family, but after 15 August, the risk to her life became grave. “After the Taliban came to power, my family threw me out of the house. It is the peak of winter and I sleep in the parks. I have been attacked. I have been raped. The Taliban held me for three days and beat me,” she said. “I have no one [to care for me].”\n\nFaraydoon Fakoori, at Paiwand 34, an organisation working to help gender minorities in Afghanistan, said: “Afghanistan has always been a conservative society, but after the arrival of the Taliban, the situation has worsened. We are seeing many cases of violence, harassment and even rape.”\n\nGul said: “The return of the Taliban empowered vigilantes, homophobes, and a lot of people nurturing long-term feuds. On 14 August, your ex-wife’s angry brothers, your spurned ex, your prejudiced neighbour or uncle might have felt like they wished they could harm you, but it wasn’t worth going to prison for. On 16 August, it was open season, with no fear of punishment.”\n\nIn 2021, a Taliban spokesperson told Germany’s Bild newspaper: “For homosexuals, there can only be two punishments: either stoning, or he must stand behind a wall that will fall down on him.”\n\n*Name has been changed\n\n Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

    "content": "Clashes broke out Sunday morning in three cities across Israel as police attempted to enforce coronavirus lockdown restrictions in a number of ultra-Orthodox communities.\n\nIn the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim, hundreds of people clashed with police attempting to shut down a yeshiva that had opened illegally.\n\nPolice said that officers who arrived at the yeshiva, or religious seminary, were quickly surrounded by a crowd shouting insults at them and throwing trash and other debris in their direction.\n\nVideo of the incident showed a number of people calling the officers “Nazis” and “kapos,” the name for Jewish collaborators coerced into service by the Third Reich.\n\nPolice said one person was arrested and water cannon trucks were later brought in to disperse the crowd.In the southern coastal city of Ashdod, police were confronted while closing down studies at an ultra-Orthodox elementary school that had opened despite Health Ministry and Education Ministry rules preventing in-person studies.Police said “several dozen people who arrived on the scene tried to force their way into the compound and confronted the officers inside.” Police added that the intruders injured four officers and caused damage to the fence surrounding the school.\n\nProtesters who had gathered outside also blocked traffic and confronted police officers, the statement said. Four people were arrested.In the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, several clashes reportedly broke out as police tried to shut down schools linked to the Vizhnitz Hasidic dynasty, whose head rabbi on Saturday ruled that educational institutions should open, before apparently backtracking hours later.\n\nPolice said in response to the violence that they would continue to enforce virus restrictions, “in all communities.”The lockdown, in its third week and extended till January 31, has shuttered all nonessential businesses along with the entire education system, excluding special education. Some ultra-Orthodox schools, however, have continued to operate in violation of the rules.Last week clashes broke out between police and rioters opposed to coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Bnei Brak after a mob in the city injured a police officer on patrol. At least six people were arrested for disturbing the peace. Those rioters belonged to an extremist faction of the Vizhnitz Hasidic sect, according to Hebrew media reports.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the Friday attack in Bnei Brak, stating that “we will act with a heavy hand against lawbreakers, first and foremost against those who raised their hands against our policewomen and policemen.”\n\nCritics have accused Netanyahu of avoiding cracking down on the Haredi public in order not to anger his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners.\n\nAdditional reports of lockdown violations among the ultra-Orthodox emerged Saturday, including a mass gathering over the weekend in the Sanz Hasidic sect in Netanya. Other sects are expected to hold prayers and gatherings this week.On Thursday, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein called for jailing those who broke lockdown rules.\n\nNetanyahu and Edelstein made appeals last week to Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, a leading ultra-Orthodox rabbi, asking that he influence the community to obey the lockdown. According to the Haaretz daily on Saturday, Kanievsky gave permission for some ultra-Orthodox schools to reopen this week, but only if it does not spark a confrontation with police. The report said some schools were hesitant to reopen despite his approval.Haredi communities have suffered disproportionately from the coronavirus, with infection rates in many ultra-Orthodox areas several times that of non-Haredi areas. High infection rates among Haredim are partly due to large family size and environmental factors, but experts also blame rule-breaking in large pockets of the community, often supported by rabbis and other community leaders.\n\nThe Health Ministry on Sunday reported a further decline in daily coronavirus infections the day before, as Israel’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began appeared to ease after weeks of strict lockdown rules and as the vaccination program continued to be rolled out.\n\nAccording to the ministry, 2,394 new cases were confirmed Saturday, after peaking at over 10,100 a week earlier. Sunday’s numbers are usually lower due to reduced testing at the weekend.\n\nThe total number of infections recorded in Israel reached 595,097, and the death toll stood at 4,361.\n\nThe ministry said there were 75,053 active cases, with 1,822 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Of those, 1,228 were in serious condition.",

Flat and cratered areas on the dwarf planet's surface point to its varied geological activity, composition and evolution over time. The jagged spikes targeted in this latest study form at the highest altitudes on Pluto's surface, near its atmosphere, where methane is able to freeze out of the atmosphere — skipping straight from gas to solid without ever becoming liquid. When the climate is a bit warmer, parts of the methane ice sublimate away, heading straight back to gas form, according to the new study.\n\n\"When we realized that bladed terrain consists of tall deposits of methane ice, we asked ourselves why it forms all of these ridges, as opposed to just being big blobs of ice on the ground,\" Jeffrey Moore, a New Horizons team member and lead researcher on the new work, said in a statement. \"It turns out that Pluto undergoes climate variation and sometimes, when Pluto is a little warmer, the methane ice begins to basically 'evaporate' away.\"On Earth, such structures are called penitentes, and stretch just a few meters in height in high-altitude regions along the planet's equator. Slight irregularities can turn into dramatic spikes of snow as the structures' surfaces concentrate sunlight toward certain regions, sublimating some parts faster than others and leading to longer and spikier forms.\n\nThe presence of penitentes on Pluto tell researchers more about how its surface and air temperature change over time, according to the statement, and the link between methane's presence and high elevations can help researchers map the dwarf planet's topography in places where they have lower-resolution views.The new work will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Icarus.",

On Sep 10th 2018 Authorities reported 20 people have died as result of the accident, 3 passengers survived.\n\nInitial information reported the aircraft had impacted Yirol River (sources including Radio Miraya absolutely ruled out the aircraft was in Yirol Lake) about 1.75nm south of the aerodrome while on approach to the runway at approximate position N6.53 E30.49.\n\nThe Information Minister in Eastern Lakes State reported the aircraft carried 23 people. 19 bodies were recovered, 4 survivors were taken to a hospital. The rescue and recovery was done by local fishing boats present at the accident site. Low visibility may have contributed to the accident. A domestic carrier named Southwest (editorial note: there is no evidence of that carrier on the Internet) had chartered the aircraft to carry out a passenger flight from Juba to Yirol City. South Sudan's Civil Aviation Authority have opened an investigation.\n\nOn Sep 10th 2018 the Minister stated, that 20 people died as result of the crash, three passengers survived. Eastern Lake State declared three days of national mourning.\n\nIn the evening of Sep 9th 2018 The Aviation Herald received a passenger manifest showing the operator of the flight was South West Aviation, the aircraft operated was UR-TWO. The handwritten manifest lists 17 adults and 3 children as passengers, one of the adults is listed as Ugandan Citizen, one an Ethiopian Citizen, all others as South Sudan Citizens.\n\nItalian Media report an Italian citizen, working as doctor for a NGO in South Sudan (the name appears on the manifest as South Sudan Citizen), is amongst the survivors and has been taken to Juba with serious injuries.\n\nAccording to Russian databases (who updated their information on Sep 9th 2018 after the accident, initially the aircraft's owner was shown unknown since 2017) the aircraft, MSN 841328, was operated by Ukrainian company \"Universal-Avia\" tail number RA-67102 until 2008, then was put into storage. In 2017 the aircraft is being owned by \"SlavAir\" based in Kiev (Ukraine). the tail number changed to UR-TWO. Pictorial evidence shows the airframe being restored to flying condition in Rivne (Ukraine) in 2016, the paint scheme already carries the operator name \"South West\" with South Sudanese Mobile Phone Number on it (Country Code 211, mobile phone provider 91). According to Ukrainian trade registers \"SlavAir Company LLC\" is based at Kiev Borispil Airport and engages in aircraft maintenance, rental and leasing of transport aircraft and passenger air transport, according to Ukrainian trade databases the company has less than 10 employees. According to a protocol certified on Jan 9th 2018 new partners joined the company in a meeting of Dec 11th 2017. In September 2018 the domain of SlavAir slavair.com is however expired and offered for sale, the last Facebook entry by the airline, showing a photo of Let L410 UR-ONE as one of their aircraft, was made in 2016, and there is no current sign of life by the company (past Apr 2018). No information about \"South West\" or their phone numbers is available online.\n\nAccording to Ukraine's Aircraft Registry the L-410 MSN 841328 was assigned tail number UR-TWO on Apr 11th 2018, the owner is named SlavAir Company with no operator mentioned. UR-ONE on the other hand, identified as one of SlavAir's aircraft by the company on their Facebook account in 2016, has officially been registered to Nigerian N.S. in Kiev (Ukraine) on Mar 24th 2016.\n\nOn Nov 19th 2018 Ukraine's NBAAI reported SlavAir's L-410 registration UR-TWO suffered an accident at Yirol falling into the lake. 20 people were killed, 3 received injuries. South Sudan's Civil Aviation Authority is conducting the accident investigation. The NBAAI have assigned an accredited representative to the investigation, between Oct 29th 2018 and Nov 2nd 2018 the NBAAI read out and decrypted the parametric data.\n\nNo weather data for Yirol are available.\n\nOn Oct 23rd 2019 Ukraine's NBAAI published the final report released by South Sudan's Ministry of Transport (SSMOT) concluding the probable causes of the crash were:\n\nThe committee for the investigations of Slav Air Let410 aircraft registration UR-TWO has finally concluded that the cause of the accident at Yirol Eastern Lake State Republic of South Sudan was caused by a combination of the following factors:\n\n- Severly bad weather in the morning of the accident. ( Not making a decision to return to Juba or diverting to the nearest Airport Rumbek)\n\n- Pilot incompetency and error in setting the altimeter for Yirol airstrip before the crash. (Causing variations in altitude flying at false altitude below the actual flight level)\n\n- Replacement of a faulty propeller in Pibor and not informing the safety department of the changes and not being given the release documents for operations.\n\nThe SSMOT reported the captain (57, ATPL, total flight hours and flight hours on type lost with pilot logbook) was assisted by a first officer (27, ATPL, total flight hours and flight hours on type lost with pilot logbook). The SSMOT annotated: \"According to the Director of Safety and Flight Operation, the crew members from Republic of Sudan who flew the aircraft on the day of the accident were not inspected by the South Sudan Safety and Flight Operation Department of Airworthiness. Their currency status, licenses and qualifications were unknown to South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority until after the crash.\"\n\nThe SSMOT reported with respect to weather:\n\nTAF/ YIROL 090500Z 0906/1012 VRB03KT 8000 FG FEW030 SCT140\n\nThe terminal weather Forecast(TAF] for Yirol area was reported as follow:\n\nOn the 9th of September 2018, at 5:00 Zulu( 8:00am local], and at 6:00Zulu ( 9:00am- local time, the wind was blowing from 100° at 12 nautical miles variable at 3 nautical miles. 8000 meters fog reported. Few clouds at 3,000 feet and scattered clouds at 14,000 thousand feet.\n\nThe weather forecast, during the flight was clearly visible and the visibility deteriorated when they entered the clouds. The visibility was less than a few meters that one could hardly see anybody in front (heavily fogged according to ground witnesses that day] and disabled the crew to clearly see the runway or the airport.\n\nThe crew circled several times over the town trying to locate the runway. As a result, the crew miscalculated and crash landed the plane into the Lake Yirol.\n\nThis incident was confirmed by the local fishermen when they heard a plane circling and later heard a bang just close by.\n\nThe SSMOT reported the laboratory analysis of the FDR, which recorded on a photosensitive film, resulted in the NBAAI reporting: \"As a result of analysis performed by the laboratory experts, it was found that the accident data is missing on the photosensitive film because, by the time of the accident, the photosensitive film inside the cassette had come to its end. As a result of the analysis, experts concluded that the lack of flight data information does not provide a chance to determine the cause of the accident by this flight data recorder.\"\n\nThe SSMOT analysed:\n\nAfter recovery of the wreckage from lake Yirol, the aircraft instrument panel was recovered together with most of the aircraft instruments.\n\nIt was analyzed that most the aircraft instruments frozen in the impact according to the instrument panel read as follws:\n\n- The altimeter reading was 1,780 ft.\n- Airspeed Indicator was 300 km/hr.\n- Attitude Indicator was showing -25°( decent]\n- Vertical speed was reading -4° [descent],\n- Revolutions per minute (RPM) reading was 190hp.\n- Heading Indicator reading was at 280° degrees.\n- Barometric Altimeter reading was 290°\n- Fuel indicator reading was (Left tank showing 400 ltrs and Right showing 3201trs].\n- Turn coordinator reading was 3°Left.\n\nThe SSMOT released following findings:\n\n1. The aircraft is owned by a Ukrainian company called Slav Air company and was leased to Southwest Aviation and entered into Republic of South Sudan in May 2018.\n\n2. The aircraft was issued a ferry flight permit from Khartoum- Sudan to Juba- South Sudan by a Captain from Slav-Air plus two crew from The Republic of Ukraine for repositioning on the 17th of May 2018 and the insurance coverage was valid.\n\n3. Weather report was not good; visibility was very poor due to fog at destination airport.\n\n4. The crew which crashed were different than those who brought the aircraft to South Sudan, and before the crash the aircraft was flown by the two pilots brought from Khartoum by Southwest, and were not inspected by the SSCAA according to inspectors from Flight Safety Department.\n\n5. Previously, a week before the crash, the aircraft had undergone some power plant maintenance in Pibor due to propellers malfunction, were not issued a Certificate of released to service from CAA inspectors but just started operations without informing the SSCAA about this incident which is a must procedure.\n\n6. The South West company crew did not check the weather briefing at Meteorology department before their departure. This was proved in the sign-in log book which had not been signed by the crew and when asked by the investigators to provide the aircraft load sheet, it was missing and the operator could not provide one.\n\n7. Baby Air Tours and Travel Company chartered the airplane from the South West Aviation company and put their passengers travelling to Yirol the day of the accident.\n\n8. The company operation manager indicated that the engineer dispatched the aircrafton 9/09/2018 and then he returned to Ukraine on the same morning of the accident day.",

It’s a moral issue.”In her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth.\n\nSixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\n\nSeventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes.Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy.\n\nDr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.\n\nCurrent annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.\n\n'Valuable' study\nThe study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.Some of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don’t.\n\nProfessor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “This is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.\n\nLibby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: “People shouldn’t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.”\n\n“Better design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints. These savings aren’t necessarily covered by this study.”",

    "content": "For the past three years, Alicia Soto has traveled back to the city where her life was changed forever.\n\nThe emotional scars from the Route 91 Harvest music festival mass shooting have not fully healed, but Soto said that attending the 1 October Sunrise Remembrance Ceremony every year has helped her process her trauma. On Thursday, the 42-year-old was one of about 200 people wearing face masks and standing 6 feet apart in the Clark County Government Center’s outdoor amphitheater for the ceremony.\n\n“That night I lost a part of me, and I come back looking for it,” Soto said, with tears in her eyes.\n\nSince October 2017, Soto has moved from California to Minneapolis and has started her dream job as a flight attendant. She said that she decided to “live life to the fullest” for those who died in the attack.\n\nA slideshow during the ceremony displayed the names and pictures of the 58 people killed that night. The pictures of two women who died within the past year of injuries they suffered in the mass shooting were included at the end with a message reading, “In Memoriam of 1 October Victims Lost in the Last Year.”At the end of the ceremony, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced that the two women, Kimberly Gervais of Mira Loma, California, and Samanta Arjune of Las Vegas, will be added to the official death toll, raising the number from 58 to 60.\n\nThe announcement came after the Review-Journal on Monday published an article that highlighted their deaths and reported the Metropolitan Police Department’s initial decision not to include them in the death total.“It isn’t like we’re trying to avoid the names,” Lombardo said in a brief interview after the ceremony. He later added that, “At this point, I think I’m comfortable in acknowledging that the other two individuals lost their lives as a result of 1 October.”\n\nThere were fewer people at the ceremony this year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced officials to limit the number of people who could attend. Gov. Steve Sisolak, who also addressed the crowd, said that when he raised the limit on public gatherings this week, Thursday’s event was one of his “biggest priorities.”Sisolak’s voice grew shaky as he recalled that night and offered his condolences to the family members of those who died.\n\n“We will never, never forget what happened that day, or the lives that were lost, and the lives that were changed,” he said.\n\nAlbert Rivera, the father of Jordyn Rivera, who was 21 when she was killed in the attack, said he was thankful to all the survivors who continue to come together on the anniversary and support each other.\n\n“We are all a statistic — we are all part of this unwanted fraternity we didn’t chose to be a part of,” he said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged Greg Zanis, an Illinois carpenter who built 58 crosses honoring those who died in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Zanis died in May of terminal bladder cancer, and Rivera said he will “be forever changed” by Zanis’ kindness.\n\nHe ended his remarks by calling for unity during what he said has been a time of divisiveness in the U.S. He urged people to remember how they came together on Oct. 2, 2017.\n\n“It’s said that it takes more effort to hate than to love. Let’s remember that,” he said. “Until we meet again — here, there or in the air — may we all smile like Jordyn.”",

    "content": "Revisions to the Coal and Mineral Mining Law that would protect corruptors, criminalise communities and endanger people and the environment are now under discussion by incoming legislators, despite President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s request last year for the process to be suspended. Discussions resumed last week under a newly formed working committee, comprised of members of the House of Representatives (DPR) and the government, who are now tasked with bringing the revisions into law.\n\nThe proposed revisions to the Law on Coal and Mineral Mining (known as RUU Minerba) have been widely criticised for pandering to the coal mining industry, while posing serious threats to communities and the environment. Outright rejection of the revisions was among the top demands of students who led mass protests across Indonesia in the final days of the term of the 2014-2019 DPR legislators, which ended on 30 September 2019.\n\nBut even as protests raged across the country, late at night on 25 September officials from the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources submitted their unfinished list of 938 concerns (Daftar Inventarisasi Masalah, or DIM), signalling that deliberation of the revisions could begin. Under pressure from the public (and a call from the president to delay the process), the DPR was forced to abandon its plans to push through regardless, like it did for revisions to the law on the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) a couple of weeks earlier.\n\nThis year’s incoming DPR members, made up of around 55 per cent of the same faces, seem determined to pick up where the old legislators left off. A total list of 703 concerns was put before the working committee as it convened last week, with 235 of these  proposed changes already agreed upon by members. The draft now under discussion shows no changes since last year’s mass protests and the intervention by the president.\n\nThe developments have reignited questions about Jokowi’s commitment to rectifying the problems that angered students and activists in late 2019. His re-election campaign owed its success in part to financial support from mining companies whose permits are due to expire during his current term. As the revisions promise easier contract extensions for these companies, Jokowi will likely be under growing pressure to “repay the debt”, by waving the revisions through.\n\nCatering to industry\nMore than 90 per cent of the proposed revisions to RUU Minerba cater directly to the interests of businesses and investors in the mining industry – by easing permit processes, providing long-term business certainty, and reducing elements of risk and responsibility. These are likely to be very welcome changes for the 25 coal mining companies operating in Indonesia whose permits are due to expire by 2025 – among them seven of the industry’s biggest names: Kaltim Prima Coal, Adaro, Berau Coal, Arutmin Indonesia, Kideco Jaya Agung, Multi Harapan Utama, and Tanito Harum.\n\nOne major change would see companies gain the right to extend their permits without their concessions first being offered to state-owned companies, as stipulated under the 2009 Law on Mining. The revisions would allow companies two contract extensions for a period of 10 years at a time, providing certainty for decades to come.\n\nConcession areas would become effectively unlimited – revisions would enable companies to hold more than one mining business permit (Izin Usaha Pertambangan, IUP) in a single province for the same commodity, meaning that large areas of land could be patched together under multiple permits. The current cap of 15,000 hectares under a single permit has also been dropped from the revised draft.\n\nCommunity-owned ventures could benefit from an easier process to obtain permits for Community Mining Areas (Wilayah Pertambangan Rakyat). However, these permits are a known avenue for corrupt activities by local officials and security forces. There is real potential for companies to use these permits, which are far less onerous, to avoid the social, environmental and financial obligations that would apply under the normal system.\n\nDespite this known risk, a provision on prison terms for officials who approve problematic permits under the 2009 law has been dropped in the proposed revisions, providing legal protection for corruptors. No wonder coal companies want it pushed through as quickly as possible.\n\nA danger to communities\nSeveral of the proposed changes will also create dangers for the rights and lives of affected communities. Yet the list of potential concerns (DIM) submitted to the legislature in September, and presented again to the working committee last week, was compiled in discussion only with business people and a select group of academics, without any input by communities, indigenous people, or civil society.\n\nCommunities are particularly concerned about proposed changes on rehabilitation of mining sites. Under the revised law, companies would no longer be held responsible for returning sites to their prior condition, including by filling pits that can stretch to several kilometres wide and deep. Instead, the revisions suggest that these pits could present opportunities for irrigation, or as tourist attractions.\n\nIn reality, these pits are endangering communities and killing their children. From 2014 to 2018, as many as 3,033 pits were left abandoned across Indonesia, in contravention of the current law, and claimed the lives of 140 people – many of them children, who often drown when the pits fill with rainwater.\n\nYet the revisions also aim to narrow the space for communities to make their concerns heard. While sanctions for corrupt officials have been dropped in the draft, fines and prison terms have been added for anyone who hinders or obstructs the activities of permit-holding mining companies. The right of communities to veto mining activities in their area has also been removed.\n\nThese changes will effectively strip communities of their rights and criminalise those who resist.\n\nAccelerating environmental destruction\nThe proposed revisions promote economic development via the extractive industries, regardless of the cost to people and the environment. This can only result in accelerated destruction of natural resources, and a deteriorating environment for human well-being.\n\nConsider the case of East Kalimantan’s provincial capital Samarinda, the city at the centre of Indonesia’s coal-mining boom. Deforestation and destruction of the land surface by mining activities in the surrounding area has led to increased rainwater runoff, landslides and frequent deadly flooding. From 2009 to 2014, the city experienced as many as 150 flood events. Despite this, no consideration is given in the latest proposed changes to the 2007 Law on Disaster Risk Reduction, or to reduce the environmental impact of mining.\n\nCoal is privileged as a commodity under the proposal, in conflict with government aspirations to reduce reliance on coal as an energy source. In 2018, coal still made up 60 per cent of the country’s energy mix, showing that there is still a long way to go to achieve goals set out under the national energy plan (RUEN) and other scenarios to leave coal behind.\n\nThis means that international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet targets on combatting climate change will be at stake if the proposed revisions pass into law.\n\nAs discussions on the revised law resume, it appears that communities will not be given their say on this crucial piece of legislation. The president should be held to his promise to stall the dangerous revisions, and made accountable to the people who got him elected – not the companies.",

    "content": "In December 2020, a 110-million-year-old dinosaur from Brazil stunned scientists with its furlike filaments and the spearlike feathers sprouting from its shoulders. But Ubirajara jubatus, as the scientists named the creature, is now renowned not just for its striking features. It has also sparked a legal and ethical controversy that has pitted German paleontologists and officials, who claim the fossil, against the Brazilian scientific community, which wants it back in the country. The dispute culminated last week when the journal Cretaceous Research retracted the paper describing the new dinosaur, leaving further study of Ubirajara in limbo.\n\nThe retraction, and the fierce campaign that led up to it, has also intensified scrutiny of the hundreds of other fossils—some still undescribed—exported from developing countries in the past, often under questionable circumstances. “I am happy with the outcome,” says Aline Ghilardi, a paleontologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. “It may help to reduce the interest in illegal removal of fossils from countries that protect their heritage, such as Brazil and Mexico, and [it] definitely will encourage more transparent and ethical research.”\n\nAs soon as the paper appeared online on 13 December 2020, many Brazilian paleontologists questioned the legality of the fossil’s export from Brazil. They say the fossil, which is deposited at the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe (SMNK) in Germany, lacked proper export permits and demanded its return.\n\nAccording to a 1942 Brazilian law, collecting fossils requires permits from the National Mining Agency (ANM), and any fossils found belong to the state. A 1990 decree adds that the export of fossils must be approved by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, and foreign researchers must collaborate with a Brazilian institution to study them.\n\nIn the case of Ubirajara, SMNK paleontologist Eberhard Frey and his co-authors wrote in the paper that the fossil was “brought to Germany along with scientific samples in 1995” and that authorization for the export was granted on 1 February of that year by an agent of the National Department of Mineral Production (now ANM). The permit, which Science has seen, authorized Frey to transport “two boxes containing calcareous samples with fossils, without any commercial value, with the main objective to proceed with paleontological studies” at SMNK. (José Betimar Melo Filgueira, the now-retired official who signed it, told Brazilian news portal G1 last year that the researchers “also needed authorization from the Ministry of Science and Technology.”)\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Science, Research and Art of Baden-Württemberg state in Germany, which manages SMNK, told Science last week that press accounts of the 1995 export are inaccurate. The fossil was not brought to Germany by Frey, the spokesperson said. Instead, it was imported in 2006 by a private company and acquired 3 years later, in 2009, by SMNK. Frey did not respond to a request for comment on the conflicting accounts.The fossil’s publication last year was followed by an intense week of thousands of social media posts using the hashtag #UbirajaraBelongstoBR, accusing the authors and SMNK of illegally taking the fossil out of the country. The journal temporarily withdrew the paper on 24 December 2020 while the controversy played out.\n\nIn the months that followed, the Brazilian scientific community, citizens, and the Federal Prosecution Office asked SMNK to clarify the fossil’s legal provenance and to repatriate the fossil. Last month, the Baden-Württemberg ministry backed the museum’s ownership claim. In a statement, it said the Ubirajara fossil was “demonstrably legally acquired” under German law and international conventions and that “all specimens in the SMNK collections, including those from Brazil, are property of the State of Baden-Württemberg.” SMNK holds more than 40 other fossils from Brazil, says Felipe Pinheiro, a paleontologist at the Federal University of Pampa, São Gabriel.\n\nThe ministry’s ownership claim outraged the Brazilian paleontology community. “I am speechless,” says Juan Carlos Cisneros, a paleontologist at the Federal University of Piauí. It also failed to satisfy editors at Cretaceous Research. Last week, the journal decided to permanently withdraw the paper, “given that concerns regarding permissions for specimen export remain unresolved 9 months after its initial publication,” a spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes the journal, told Science.\n\nThe journal also updated its policy on fossil provenance earlier this month to say it will not accept papers about specimens “that are suspected to have been collected and exported illegally from their countries of origin, are of uncertain provenance, or are deposited in private collections.” This update resembles recent policy changes at other journals, such as Science, Nature, Nature Ecology & Evolution, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“For Elsevier the internet aggression was evidently sufficient to permanently withdraw the paper,” Frey wrote in an email to Science. “The pressure apparently reached too high a level and they have a reputation to lose.”\n\nThe permanent withdrawal of the paper has rekindled Brazilian demands for the fossil’s repatriation. “It’s the right thing to do,” says Alexander Kellner, a paleontologist and director of the National Museum at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. And the Baden-Württemberg ministry is now reconsidering its position. The spokesperson told Science it will “intensively examine the processes again” and is open to talking “with the Brazilian side in order to explore the possibilities of an agreeable solution.”\n\nUbirajara is far from unique. In a preprint posted in June, scientists analyzed about 28,000 papers on fossils published in the past 30 years. They found that Germany, the United Kingdom, and France have each contributed more than 10% of paleontology papers but that most such research—88%, in the case of Germany—was carried out with fossils from abroad. More than half of the German papers did not include local authors—a practice some researchers call “parachute science” and journals are starting to tackle.\n\nSome paleontologists argue that fossils obtained from developing countries such as Brazil and Morocco are better off at institutions in Europe and the United States, where they can be safely stored; they note the fire that engulfed Brazil’s National Museum 3 years ago. “The museums in Brazil appear to be severely underfunded,” says David Martill of the University of Portsmouth, a co-author of the Ubirajara paper.\n\nBut Brazilian scientists counter that disaster can strike anywhere, pointing to the fire that gutted Notre Dame de Paris in 2019. “We have good science, we have good scientists, we have infrastructure to take good care of this material,” Ghilardi says.\n\nThe controversy has prompted other researchers to repatriate Brazilian fossils voluntarily. This week, for example, a spider fossil described in May and 35 other specimens currently at the University of Kansas’s Natural History Museum will return to Brazil, a spokesperson there told Science.\n\nMeanwhile, the retraction of the Ubirajara paper has left scientists wondering what will happen with the new species and other undescribed fossils at SMNK. “As long as the paper is unavailable, this species becomes nonexistent to science,” Pinheiro says. “It’s like a second extinction!”",

    "content": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has captured for the first time enough light from planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets, to identify molecules in their atmospheres. The landmark achievement is a significant step toward being able to detect possible life on rocky exoplanets and comes years before astronomers had anticipated. \n\n\"This is an amazing surprise,\" said Spitzer project scientist Dr. Michael Werner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"We had no idea when we designed Spitzer that it would make such a dramatic step in characterizing exoplanets.\" \n\nSpitzer, a space-based infrared telescope, obtained the detailed data, called spectra, for two different gas exoplanets. Called HD 209458b and HD 189733b, these so-called \"hot Jupiters\" are, like Jupiter, made of gas, but orbit much closer to their suns. \n\nThe data indicate the two planets are drier and cloudier than predicted. Theorists thought hot Jupiters would have lots of water in their atmospheres, but surprisingly none was found around HD 209458b and HD 189733b. According to astronomers, the water might be present but buried under a thick blanket of high, waterless clouds. \n\nThose clouds might be filled with dust. One of the planets, HD 209458b, showed hints of tiny sand grains, called silicates, in its atmosphere. This could mean the planet's skies are filled with high, dusty clouds unlike anything seen around planets in our own solar system. \n\n\"The theorists' heads were spinning when they saw the data,\" said Dr. Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \n\n\"It is virtually impossible for water, in the form of vapor, to be absent from the planet, so it must be hidden, probably by the dusty cloud layer we detected in our spectrum,\" he said. Richardson is lead author of a Nature paper appearing Feb. 22 that describes a spectrum for HD 209458b. \n\nIn addition to Richardson's team, two other groups of astronomers used Spitzer to capture spectra of exoplanets. A team led by Dr. Carl Grillmair of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif., observed HD 189733b, while a team led by Dr. Mark R. Swain of JPL focused on the same planet in the Richardson study, and came up with similar results. Grillmair's results will be published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Swain's findings have been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters. \n\nA spectrum is created when an instrument called a spectrograph splits light from an object into its different wavelengths, just as a prism turns sunlight into a rainbow. The resulting pattern of light, the spectrum, reveals \"fingerprints\" of chemicals making up the object. \n\nUntil now, the only planets for which spectra were available belonged in our own solar system. The planets in the Spitzer studies orbit stars that are so far away, they are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. HD 189733b is 370 trillion miles away in the constellation Vulpecula, and HD 209458b is 904 trillion miles away in the constellation Pegasus. That means both planets are at least about a million times farther away from us than Jupiter. In the future, astronomers hope to have spectra for smaller, rocky planets beyond our solar system. This would allow them to look for the footprints of life -- molecules key to the existence of life, such as oxygen and possibly even chlorophyll. \n\n\"With these new observations, we are refining the tools that we will one day need to find life elsewhere if it exists,\" said Swain. \"It's sort of like a dress rehearsal.\" \n\nSpitzer was able to tease out spectra from the feeble light of the two planets through what is known as the \"secondary eclipse\" technique. In this method -- first used by Spitzer in 2005 to directly detect the light from an exoplanet for the first time -- a so-called transiting planet is monitored as it circles behind its star, temporarily disappearing from our Earthly point of view. By measuring the dip in infrared light that occurs when the planet disappears, Spitzer can learn how much light is coming solely from the planet. The technique will work only in infrared wavelengths, where the planet is brighter than in visible wavelengths and stands out better next to the overwhelming glare of its star. \n\nIn the new studies, Spitzer's spectrograph, which measures infrared light at a range of wavelengths, stared at the two transiting planets as they orbited their stars. This allowed the astronomers to subtract the spectra of the stars from the spectra of the planets plus their stars to obtain spectra of the planets alone. \n\n\"When we first set out to make these observations, they were considered high risk because not many people thought they would work,\" said Grillmair. \"But Spitzer has turned out to be superbly designed and more than up to the task.\" \n\nPrevious observations of HD 209458b by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope revealed individual elements, such as sodium, oxygen, carbon and hydrogen, that bounce around the very top of the planet, a region higher up than that probed in the Spitzer studies and a region where molecules like water would break apart. To do this, Hubble measured changes in the light from the star, not the planet, as the planet passed in front. The observations indicated less sodium than predicted, which again supports the idea that the planet is socked in with high clouds. \n\nAstronomers hope to use Spitzer for additional studies of transiting exoplanets, which are those that cross in front of their stars from our point view. Of the approximately 200 known exoplanets, 14 are transiting. At least three of these in addition to HD 209458b and HD 189733b are candidates for obtaining spectra. Further spectral studies of HD 209458b and HD 189733b will also yield more information about the planets' atmospheres. \n\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages the Spitzer Space Telescope mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. Science operations are conducted at the Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, also in Pasadena. Caltech manages JPL for NASA. Spitzer's infrared spectrograph was built by Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. Its development was led by Dr. Jim Houck of Cornell.",

    "content": "BENGALURU (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s import tariffs will do more harm than good to the U.S. economy, say the vast majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year more than previously thought.The U.S. central bank will raise interest rates next week, all 104 economists polled by Reuters March 5-13 said, with three more hikes to follow this year, driven by a solid labor market underpinning optimism. That is more than two additional hikes after March expected in a poll taken a few weeks ago.\n\nNearly 90 percent of 71 respondents also said they were concerned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would lead to a wider trade war, including almost a third who said they were “very concerned.”\n\n“This is not new. We have seen these trade battles back and forth in the past as well. But what is different this time is the persistence and the sense that we are only looking at the tip of the iceberg on protectionism,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at BofAML.\n\n“What is concerning also is the slippery slope risk here. There is no sign of any let up in this push for protectionism with the frequency of new proposals growing. It will be very surprising if there isn’t some measured retaliation over time from major trading partners.”\n\nNearly 80 percent of 60 economists who answered a question on the tariffs said they would do more harm than good and the rest said it would do nothing or very little. Not one respondent said they would benefit the world’s largest economy.\n\n“The tariffs are likely to be met with retaliation from U.S. business partners and completely ‘miss the point’ as China is mostly kept out of range. They have the potential to become highly inflammatory and to undermine the global economic expansion,” noted Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday raised its global growth forecasts to the highest since 2011 but warned the world economy was vulnerable to trade tensions after the import tariffs.\n\nWhile Trump’s decision did very little to world stocks - which marked a nine-year bull run on Friday - the U.S. dollar extended its retreat against most major currencies. A separate Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists showed that will continue this year.\n\nThe latest poll showed the U.S. central bank will raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the March 20-21 meeting to 1.50-1.75 percent and repeat that move three more times, by once a quarter, taking the base rate to 2.25-2.50 percent by end-2018.\n\nThat is one additional hike in total compared with a poll taken last month and the Fed’s own dot plots.\n\n“All in all, the data, as well as the anecdotes, make another rate hike at the next week’s FOMC meeting almost certain unless there is some major new negative development unrelated to the economic data between now and then,” noted Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “More debatable is the extent to which the dot plot will change.”\n\nThose latest expectations come alongside an upgraded view for growth and inflation.\n\nThe Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, the core PCE price index, was forecast to reach the central bank’s 2 percent target in the third quarter and rise slightly above that next year.\n\nFull-year average core PCE inflation for 2018 was forecast at 1.8 percent and then 2.1 percent next year - the highest consensus since polling began for 2019.\n\nEconomic growth was forecast at an annualized rate of 2.5-3.0 percent each quarter this year, compared to 2.5-2.7 percent in February.\n\nFull-year median forecasts were 2.8 percent for 2018 and 2.4 percent next, compared to 2.7 percent and 2.2 percent previously.\n\nWhile most economists said fiscal stimulus from tax cuts and additional spending would benefit the economy this year they were mostly split if it had brought the next downturn closer.\n\nThirty-one of 58 economists said they were not concerned but 27 said they were, including four who said they were very concerned, on the timing of the stimulus at this stage of the already-ageing recovery.\n\nThe median probability of a recession in the coming year was 13 percent, a slight increase from 10 percent in a November poll.\n\n“The risk in stimulus now is that it pushes you closer to the end of the business cycle a little bit faster. The concern is also that you want to have your powder dry for dealing with the next recession and we know it is just a matter of time before the next,” said BofAML’s Harris.\n\n“If we go into a recession with a very big budget deficit already, it is much harder to respond with new tax cuts and spending increases. So you are using up your ammunition at a time when you don’t need to.”",

Gypsier\" over images of Gypsy boys and girls.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority ruled on Wednesday that the campaign was irresponsible, offensive and reaffirmed negative stereotypes and prejudice against the Traveller and Gypsy communities.\n\n\"As a result of this decision, Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy brand has been held up to be morally bankrupt,\" said Yvonne MacNamara, chief executive of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain. \"Channel 4 should hang its corporate head in shame.\"\n\nThe Irish Traveller Movement in Britain, and several co-complainants, successfully appealed against the original decision made in March by the ASA not to investigate the campaign, despite almost 400 complaints about the ads.\n\nChannel 4's posters included a one of young boy with an aggressive look on his face, two young women in low-cut tops and three girls elaborately dressed for their first communion.\n\nThe ASA found that one of the girls in a low-cut top, wearing heavy makeup and with part of her bra visible, was 15 – a year below the legal age children are allowed to appear in ads.\n\nChannel 4 said that the girl had turned 16 before the image was used, adding that the poster was \"not more revealing than any number of other ads, for example, swimwear products\".\n\n\"Although we understood that the girl was depicted in her own choice of dress we considered that, in choosing that image for use in a poster, Channel 4 had acted irresponsibly by depicting a child in a sexualised way,\" said the ASA.\n\nThe ASA was equally critical about Channel 4's use of the image of the aggressive-looking young boy.\n\n\"He was depicted in a way that was offensive and endorsed negative stereotypes about him and his community,\" the watchdog ruled. \"We considered that the ad reaffirmed commonly held prejudices about Gypsy and Traveller children in a way that was likely to cause distress and mental harm to children from those communities, including to the boy featured in the ad, by suggesting that was an acceptable way to portray him.\"\n\nChannel 4 said that the ad campaign used \"real and intimate\" photographic portraits in a \"journalistic, reportage style that reflected the journalistic intent of the series\".\n\nThe broadcaster said in its submission to the ASA that the campaign was approved at the highest level, which would imply it was signed off by the Channel 4 chief executive, David Abraham.\n\n\"It was not Channel 4's intention for these adverts to cause offence but we are sorry this was the case among some members of the Gypsy and Traveller community,\" said a Channel 4 spokesman. \"All responsible action was taken pre-publication: the posters were voluntarily submitted to the industry's independent CAP copy advice team who advised that they believed they complied with the advertising code; consent was obtained from contributors; and the posters were shared with those featured, who had no objections.\"\n\nChannel 4 has been backing away from its hit franchise, which derives its name from the hit movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding and has delivered massive audiences for the broadcaster.\n\nIn August, the Channel 4 chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, told the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival that the broadcaster would not be making any more series of Big Fat Gypsy Weddings. However, there will be six \"Gypsy-themed\" one-off specials next year.\n\nIn March media regulator Ofcom dismissed complaints that the TV campaign for the show breached any aspects of the broadcasting code.\n\n\"The ASA's powerful findings represent a fundamental turning point in how Travellers and Gypsies can be portrayed in the media in the future,\" said David Enright, a parner with law firm Howe & Co, which represented ITMB.",

    "content": "Pope Francis is set to break a 15-month hiatus from international travel with what is sure to be a historic visit to the Middle Eastern nation of Iraq.\n\nThe Director of the Holy See Press Office, Matteo Bruni, announced the news on Monday, adding that the Pope had accepted the invitation of the Republic of Iraq and the local Catholic Church.\n\nIt will be an Apostolic Journey covering four days and four Iraqi provinces.\n\nAccording to the Press Office statement, “He will visit Baghdad, the plain of Ur, linked to the memory of Abraham, the city of Erbil, as well as Mosul and Qaraqosh in the plain of Nineveh.”\n\nThe Pope’s itinerary will be released at a later date, and will “take into consideration the evolution of the worldwide health emergency.”\n\nLong-held desire\nPope Francis has long expressed his desire to visit Iraq.\n\nAlready on 10 June 2019 he told a meeting of Catholic aid agencies that he planned on traveling there in 2020.\n\n“I think constantly of Iraq – where I want to go next year – in the hope that it can face the future through the peaceful and shared pursuit of the common good on the part of all elements of society, including the religious, and not fall back into hostilities sparked by the simmering conflicts of the regional powers.” Years in the making\nThe Pope’s visit will come as the realization of a dream of his predecessor, Pope St. John Paul II. The Polish Pope had planned to travel to Iraq at the end of 1999. That trip never took place because Saddam Hussein decided to postpone it, after months of negotiations.\n\nAccording to Cardinal Louis Raphael Sako, the Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans, Pope Francis will receive an enthusiastic welcome to Iraq.\n\nHe told SIR news agency a year ago that “everyone in Iraq, Christians and Muslims, esteem him[Pope Francis] for his simplicity and nearness. His words touch everyone’s hearts because they are those of a shepherd. He is a man who brings peace.”\n\nPreserving Christians presence\nPreparations for Pope Francis’ visit seemed to be nearing completion early this year, when he met the President of Iraq, Barham Salih, at an audience in the Vatican on 25 January.\n\nThe Holy See Press Office said at the time that the two spoke about “preserving the historical presence of Christians in the country” and “highlighting the need to guarantee their security and a place in the future of Iraq.”\n\nAmid difficult times\nChristians’ presence in Iraq, however, has been drastically diminished in the past two decades.\n\nIn 2003, before a US-led coalition invaded to depose Saddam Hussein, there were around 1 to 1.4 million Christians in the country.\n\nA drawn-out war and the 2014-2017 occupation of the Plain of Nineveh by the so-called Islamic State reduced their number to between 300 and 400 thousand.\n\nIraq’s president and prime minister have often invited Christians who have fled the country to return and help rebuild the nation.\n\nHope springs eternal\nYet, the dream of recovery has been impeded by an economic crisis, corruption, and the plight of 1.7 million internally displaced people.\n\nUNICEF, the UN children’s aid agency, estimates that some 4 million Iraqis require humanitarian assistance, of whom half are children. Add in the Covid-19 pandemic and the situation remains dire in a country of over 38 million people.\n\nIn that context, Pope Francis’ visit to Iraq in the Spring will surely bring a breath of fresh hope to this long-suffering nation, as Cardinal Sako himself told Vatican News after Monday's announcement.",

Holiday parks and visitor centres were evacuated into Friday night and while the extent of damage to infrastructure isn't known, Mr Pengilly is worried about what will be revealed.\n\n\"To have an island more or less half burnt is unbelievable.\"\n\nThe South Australian Country Fire Service (CFS) issued an extreme fire danger warning early Saturday morning for the Ravine fire on the western end of Kangaroo Island, which said the fire \"increased considerably\" yesterday.\n\nThe fires are at a Watch and Act message.\n\nMr Pengilly said conditions were mild on the island this morning and there was even some light rain, but the CFS warns the fire remains a threat as the conditions are continually changing.\n\nLocal MP Leon Bignell said it had been a long night for those on the island, with people camped out on the Kingscote Oval and others taking shelter in a school gymnasium. He said locals who fled the fire would be looking for information from authorities on when they might return to their properties.\n\n“People over here are in shock, they’re scared, they’re frightened,” Mr Bignell told ABC radio.The Country Fire Service urged people to defer all non-essential travel to Kangaroo Island. Ferry services to Kangaroo Island will operate as scheduled today, but priority will be given to fire vehicles and personnel.\n\nKangaroo Island Mayor Michael Pengilly said part of the island looked like it had been hit by a \"nuclear bomb\".\n\n\"It has been absolutely devastating,\" Mr Pengilly told the ABC, \"... the north coast looks like it has been hit by a nuclear bomb.\"\n\n\"Flinders Chase is going to come out of this badly.

The Kremlin denies it has any role there.\n\nIn a separate development on Saturday, three powerful blasts rocked the main rebel-held city of Donetsk, with eyewitnesses saying that a chemical plant may have been hit.\n\nMeanwhile, a humanitarian convoy of about 200 lorries from Russia arrived in the city.\n\nRussia says the convoy - Russia's third in recent weeks - delivered food, water and generators, but this was done without Ukraine's authorisation.\n\n'Mercenaries'\nThe deal was reached after late-night talks between representatives of Ukraine, Russia, eastern separatists and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).Correspondents say it is an effort to add substance to the fragile ceasefire agreement.\n\nFormer Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, representing Kiev at the talks, said that all sides had agreed to move back some of their heavy weapons.\n\n\"Heavy artillery will be moved 15km away from the front line\" he said.\n\nHe added that the deal would be implemented within 24 hours and monitors from the OSCE would travel to the buffer zone to check for compliance.\n\nline\nMinsk memorandum: Key points\n\nTo pull heavy weaponry 15km by each side from the line of contact, creating a 30km security zone\nTo ban offensive operations\nTo ban flights by combat aircraft over the security zone\nTo set up an OSCE monitoring mission\nTo withdraw all foreign mercenaries from the conflict zone\nline\nSeparatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that the two sides did not discuss the status of the rebel-held areas of Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\n\"We have our opinion on it while Ukraine has its own,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukraine's parliament passed a bill granting a three-year \"self-rule\" to parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - a move described as \"capitulation\" by some Ukrainian lawmakers.\n\nThe Russian ambassador to Ukraine, Mikhail Zurabov, representing Moscow at the talks, said that \"mercenaries\" were fighting on both sides, and called on OSCE to oversee their removal.\n\nRussia has repeatedly said that any of its citizens fighting alongside separatists in Ukraine are doing so in a private capacity.\n\nBut Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of actively sending troops and heavy weapons into Ukraine.\n\nThere are now fears in Ukraine that Russia wants to create a frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine, the BBC's David Stern in Kiev reports.",

    "content": "An historic assault is being waged on the Amazon rainforest and the indigenous people who have called it home for thousands of years as the world’s population takes shelter from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDeforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose more than 50% in the first three months of 2020 compared to the same three-month period last year, according to preliminary satellite data released by the Brazilian Space Agency’s deforestation monitoring system.Even before the pandemic struck, scientists warned that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s development-friendly policies could transform the world’s largest rainforest into a drier, savannah-like landscape. Once this “tipping point” is crossed, scientists said, the ecosystem could begin emitting more greenhouse gases than it captures, effectively turning a vital tool in the fight against climate change into another source of harmful emissions.\n\nBrazil’s indigenous reserves hold some of the most pristine sections of the rainforest in the world and have long been targeted by illegal logging and mining operations seeking to exploit their natural resources. Since the outbreak started, however, Brazil’s environmental agency has scaled back more enforcement measures, leaving the forest and its indigenous tribes even more vulnerable to a litany of deadly threats.\n\n“Our territory keeps being invaded by loggers and hunters,” Laercio Guajajara, a member of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao, told ABC News. Even in the midst of the global health crisis, he said, there were “still a lot of invasions.”\n\nNow, those so-called invaders could leave more than just environmental destruction in their wake.\n\n“We are desperate,” Andre Karipuna, a 27-year-old member of the tiny Karipuna tribe of in the state of Rondonia, told the Environmental Justice Foundation. “The Karipuna are a small isolated community and just one infected person could rapidly pass the virus on to the whole tribe.”\n\nBrazil’s indigenous tribe’s have already been under increased pressure since Bolsonaro took office in 2019. He immediately began slashing funding and enforcement at FUNAI, the country’s department of indigenous affairs that provides essential services to indigenous communities across the nation. In July 2019, he appointed a federal police officer with connections to agribusiness to head the agency.\n\nSome tribal leaders have taken defense of their lands into their own hands. Last summer, ABC News was granted rare access to one such group, the Guajajara tribe’s “Guardians,” embedding within their ragtag convoy of trucks and motorcycles during a four-day patrol over several dozen miles of dense terrain.\n\nWith cameras rolling, the “Guardians” pursued an illegal logging operation deep into the jungle, employing satellite imagery, intelligence gathering and old-fashioned tracking along the way. The resulting documentary, “Guardians of the Amazon” captured a complex struggle, featuring powerful industrial interests, complicit tribal villagers, indifferent government agencies — and an ever-present fear of violent reprisals.Now, in the midst of the pandemic, the Brazilian government is again advancing controversial legislation regarding indigenous lands, potentially compounding tribes' vulnerability to invasion and infection.\n\nIn April, Bolsonaro's indigenous affairs agency, FUNAI, passed the controversial law IN 09. The new rule prevents long-held indigenous lands waiting for official demarcation from being labelled as \"indigenous\" in the land registry as they wait.\n\nEnvironmental groups allege the new law provides a route for those who illegally occupy indigenous lands to claim the land is not indigenous. According to Greenpeace, the seemingly obscure rule change will have drastic consequences for the nearly one third of indigenous lands still awaiting official designation by the government.\n\nAnother controversial rule, Provisional Measure (MP) 910, first decreed by Bolsonaro in December 2019, is now being considered for permanent law. The measure allows those who illegally deforested and occupied protected federal lands before December 2018 to purchase the property at reduced prices.\n\nCritics allege the rule is a reward for illegal land grabbers and criminal gangs who seized protected lands from indigenous tribes, and an analysis by the not-for-profit organization IMAZON found the measure could lead to the added deforestation of up to 16,000 square kilometers of rainforest by 2027.The Bolsonaro administration denies the new land ownership rules would facilitate and legitimize land-grabbing, arguing new landowners will be required to preserve up to 80% of their land and will only grant legal titles to those who occupied federal lands in a “tame and peaceful way for many years.” The measure could be passed by a virtual vote within a few weeks, without being subject to standard scrutiny, according to environmental groups.\n\nSince the enforcement rollbacks, reports of illegal logging and violent attacks across the region’s indigenous reserves have increased. Grave concern is widespread among indigenous tribes both large and small.\n\nIn early April, Indigenous leaders from the Yanomami reserve, the country’s largest, began reporting an increase in illegal gold mining during the pandemic. BBC Brasil published satellite photographs showing illegal miners moving into an area of the reserve where one isolated community lives. Some leaders reportedly blamed the invasions for the April 10th death of a 15-year-old boy who was the first among Yanomami known to die from the virus.\n\nThe Karipuna indigenous tribe of Rondonia -- one of the smallest and most vulnerable indigenous tribes in the country with less than 100 people – submitted a complaint to federal prosecutors on April 8th stating non-indigenous people were clearing inside their reserve.\n\n\"It is urgent that the authorities take surgical and structural measures to combat land grabbing underway [at the reserve]\" the complaint reads, demanding the identification, arrest, and withdrawal of the invaders.Some tribes are reporting an increase in land-use related bloodshed during the pandemic. On April 18th, a 33-year-old indigenous leader of the Uru-eu-wau-wau reserve in Rondonia was reportedly assassinated. The leader had been known for his outspoken criticism of illegal logging.\n\nAnd in March, Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao was killed by a shotgun-wielding assailant that has yet to be found, according to Amazon Watch. A teacher and longtime supporter of the Guajajara’s “Guardians of the Forest,” Zezico was reportedly gunned down while riding his motorcycle, becoming the fifth Guajajara murdered in as many months.\n\n“Indigenous lands are living a very difficult time,” Erival Guajajara, a 29-year-old member of the Guajajara told ABC News. “We are afraid for our lives because of our vulnerability.”",

    "content": "A hacking group that appears to be linked to the Iranian government attempted to break into U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign but were unsuccessful, sources familiar with the operation told Reuters on Friday.\nMicrosoft Corp said earlier on Friday that it saw \"significant\" cyber activity by the group which also targeted current and former U.S. government officials, journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran, the company said in a blog post.Republican Trump's official campaign website is the only one of the remaining major contenders' sites that is linked to Microsoft's cloud email service, according to an inspection of publicly available mail exchanger records.The Trump campaign's Director of Communications Tim Murtaugh said, \"We have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.\"\nIn a 30-day period between August and September, the group, dubbed \"Phosphorous\" by the company, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts belonging to specific customers and then attacked 241 of those accounts.\n\"Four accounts were compromised as a result of these attempts; these four accounts were not associated with the U.S. presidential campaign or current and former U.S. government officials,\" the blog post said. \"Microsoft has notified the customers related to these investigations and threats and has worked as requested with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them.\"\nMicrosoft's blog post did not identify the election campaign whose network was targeted by Phosphorous hackers. Nineteen Democrats are seeking their party's nomination to run for president in the November 2020 election. Three Republicans have announced their candidacy to challenge Trump in the party's nominating contest.\nHacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments, especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Moscow has denied any meddling.\nTensions between the United States and Iran have risen since May 2018 when Trump withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions. Trump has since reinstated U.S. sanctions, putting increased pressure on the Iranian economy, including its oil trade.\nThe Iranian government did not issue any immediate comment through state-run media on Microsoft's statement.\nPhosphorus is also known as APT 35, Charming Kitten, and Ajax Security Team, according to Microsoft.\nThe Redmond, Washington-based company said Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts.\nThe attacks were not technically sophisticated, the blog said. Hackers tried to use a significant amount of personal information to attack targets, it said.\n\"This effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering,\" the blog post said.\nMicrosoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and said in March that it had received a court order to take control of 99 websites the group used to execute attacks .\nA computer network used by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaignwas hacked in a cyberattack on Democratic Party political organizations in that U.S. election.Big tech companies are under pressure to ramp up security for next year's U.S. elections and others around the world.\nCompanies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft and Twitter Inc met with U.S. intelligence agencies earlier in September to discuss security strategies.\nMicrosoft had said in a blog post in Julythat about 10,000 customers were targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks in the past year. Most of the activity originated from hackers in three countries: Iran, North Korea and Russia, the company said.",

It has sunk in waters about 30 meters to 35 meters (98 to 115 ft) deep, about 15 km (9 miles) north of the coast of Java island.\n\nHere are details of what investigators will look for, and on the airline and the aircraft.\n\nFINDING THE ‘BLACK BOXES’\n\nThe top priority will be finding the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder to help determine the cause, safety experts said.\n\nThe pilots had asked to turn back to base shortly before losing contact with air traffic control, a spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation authorities said.\n\nData from flight tracking service FlightRadar24 shows the first sign of something amiss came about two minutes into the flight, when the plane had reached 2,000 feet.\n\nThen it descended more than 500 feet and veered to the left before climbing again to 5,000 feet, where it stayed during most of the rest of the flight.\n\nIt began gaining speed in the final moments to reach 345 knots (397 mph) before data was lost when it was at 3,650 feet.\n\nAs the plane crashed in shallow water, recovering the black boxes should be easier than with deepwater crashes such as AirAsia Indonesia flight QZ8501 in 2014 and Air France flight 447 in 2009, said Greg Waldron, managing editor of Flightglobal Asia, an industry publication.\n\nThe jet involved in the crash had a technical problem on a flight from the resort island of Bali to Jakarta on Sunday, but the issue was resolved ‘according to procedure’, Lion Air Chief Executive Edward Strait said, but declined to elaborate.\n\nSAFETY RECORD\nThe privately-owned budget carrier was founded in 1999 and its only prior fatal accident had been in 2004, when an MD-82 crashed upon landing at Solo City, killing 25 of the 163 aboard, according to the Flight Safety Foundation’s Aviation Safety Network.\n\nHowever, six other Lion Air jets, including one that crash-landed in the water short of the runway at Bali in 2013, were damaged beyond repair in various accidents, Aviation Safety Network said.\n\nIn June 2016, the European Union took Lion Air off its air safety blacklist.Indonesia has had a “chequered past” in terms of air safety, including hull losses such as those experienced by Lion Air, and there is room to improve, said Shukor Yusof, the head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.\n\n“Indonesia needs help,” he said. “Many factors have to be looked into, including the air traffic management system, maintenance, training and so on, to cope with a rapid increase in the number of planes and passengers each year.”\n\nBOEING 737 MAX\nLion Air flight JT 610 is the world's first crash of a Boeing Co BA.N 737 MAX, introduced into commercial service last year as a more fuel-efficient version of the manufacturer's workhorse single-aisle jet.\n\nLion Air, via its Malaysian subsidiary Malindo Air, was the first carrier globally to take delivery of the 737 MAX last year.\n\nBy the end of September, Boeing had delivered 219 of the 4,783 orders it has received for the 737 MAX, according to its order book.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co LUV.N has received 23, making it the biggest operator of the aircraft, followed by Air Canada AC.TO with 18, American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O with 15 and Lion Air with 13, Boeing data shows.Operators including Lion Air, SilkAir and flydubai said they had no plans to remove their 737 MAX jets from service after Monday’s crash.\n\nThe 737 MAX 8 uses LEAP-1B engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co GE.N and Safran SA SAF.PA.\n\nThe jet that crashed on Monday was delivered in August and had 800 hours of flying time, Lion Air said. It was leased from CMIG Aviation Capital, an arm of China Minsheng Investment Group, the Flightglobal Ascend database shows.\n\nIn April, Lion Air announced a firm order to buy 50 of the larger Boeing 737 MAX 10 narrowbody jets with a list price of $6.24 billion. Lion Air is one of the U.S. planemaker’s largest customers globally.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing said they were providing assistance in the investigation into the Lion Air crash.",

    "content": "On Tuesday night, Twitter permanently banned the conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos as it cracked down on a wave of racist abuse targeting the \"Ghostbusters\" actor Leslie Jones.\n\nTwitter also told the Breitbart Tech writer, who is also one of the best-known figures among the Internet's \"alt-right,\" that his account would not be restored in the future. The permanent suspension is the social network's strongest response against those who break its abuse and harassment policies, but we know very little about how Twitter decides when to use it.Twitter doesn't generally comment on questions about individual accounts, citing privacy and security reasons. Users who are perma-banned from Twitter are, as a practice, not told which tweets of theirs prompted the ban — only that they are banned, that their accounts will not be restored, and which part of Twitter's rules the company says were violated.\n\nTwitter also doesn't have publicly available guidelines for the threshold that must be met for a permanent ban; it only states in its rules against abusive behaviour that \"any accounts and related accounts engaging in the activities specified below may be temporarily locked and/or subject to permanent suspension.\"\n\nTwitter declined to provide The Washington Post with additional information on which policy violations have triggered permanent suspensions in the past, or the frequency with which Twitter hands them out for abuse and harassment violations.\n\nBelow, we've rounded up five high-profile instances of Twitter's permanent ban in action. But before we get to that, here's a caveat: While we've done our best to determine the status of each of these accounts, a permanent ban can look a lot like a temporary suspension from the outside. Some users who have been temporarily suspended from Twitter may simply choose not to take action to restore their accounts.\n\nIn three of these cases, the banned individuals have provided screenshots of the messages Twitter sent them announcing their permanent bans. In the other two cases, the context and fallout from their suspensions make it seem extremely likely that the bans were permanent.\n\n• Milo Yiannopoulos\n\nTwitter permanently banned Yiannopoulos — aka @nero on Twitter — in the immediate fallout from a racist abuse campaign against Jones. Jones quit Twitter on Monday, after posting screenshots of an onslaught of comments she was getting.\n\nYiannopoulos often used his popular Twitter account to identify and mock enemies of the \"alt-right,\" a grouping of anti-PC diehards, trolls and racist meme lords who have united around their common liberal targets.\n\nOn Monday, Yiannopoulos started making fun of Jones, particularly her response to the racist abuse she was getting. \"EVERYONE GETS HATE MAIL FFS,\" one tweet read. another called Jones \"barely literate.\" Later, he shared faked screenshots that made it appear as if Jones were making profane and offensive postings.\n\nTwitter didn't say exactly why it banned Yiannopoulos, only telling the Breitbart writer that he was permanently banned for a violation of their rules \"prohibiting participating in or inciting targeted abuse of individuals.\" Yiannopoulos called the suspension \"cowardly.\"\n\nReactions to Yiannopoulos' suspension fell along the lines you'd expect: His supporters — he had more than 300,000 followers at the time of his suspension — rallied behind the #FreeMilo hashtag, which trended in the United States for several hours, and said that he'd done nothing wrong. Many others cheered Twitter's decision to ban someone whose mocking, trollish tweets about people on the alt-right's bad side were often the prelude to a mob of abuse.\n\nThe Yiannopoulos ban was part of Twitter's response to the abuse targeting Jones, Twitter said in a statement Tuesday. The company said it was \"continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it's happening and prevent repeat offenders,\" and promised changes to its reporting system and harassment policies in the \"coming weeks.\"\n\nTwitter's ban hammer fell this time when many eyes were watching for Twitter's response. The media gave significant coverage to the onslaught of racism Jones was enduring, and a chorus of celebrities implored Twitter to take decisive action.\n\nJillian York, a co-founder of OnlineCensorship.org, said that all that attention likely played a role in how Twitter handled this particular instance of mass abuse. \"The real issue here is scrutiny,\" York told the Intersect.\n\nYiannopoulos was subject to several warnings from the social network over the course of his Twitter career and had lost his blue verification check mark in January for violating Twitter's rules. If he tries to return to Twitter, the site will likely notice and take action to remove him again, quickly. The question becomes whether it's even possible for Twitter to give the same scrutiny to the mob of regular accounts that harassed Jones on Monday. How long would it take for Twitter to discover if they return?\n\nOnlineCensorship.org tracks instances of account suspensions and content takedowns across several social media platforms. Their data suggests that not all instances of rule violations play out the same over time and that one major factor seems to be celebrity.\n\n\"Regular users, when they lose their account to a ban, can simply start up another and go unnoticed (unless they attract attention again or get reported),\" York said. \"We see this with IS-supporting users all the time — their large-follow account goes down, and the next thing you know, they're regaining on another one.\"\n\n• Charles C. Johnson\n\nIn his time as Twitter's most notorious troll, Johnson did a lot to earn his reputation as an Internet villain. He published the home addresses of New York Times reporters. He broadcast the full name of the woman at the centre of Rolling Stone's now-discredited University of Virginia rape story (and circulated an image that he said was of her — it wasn't).\n\nJohnson, who is practicing his particular version of bounty hunting-as-journalism elsewhere, seemed to always have a target, or a good sense of the line between accountability and malice. But it was a tweet asking for funds for \"taking out\" Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson that, it appears, prompted Twitter to ban him permanently from the platform in May 2015.\n\nThe ban came about a month after Twitter expanded the language it used to describe prohibited threatening behaviour on the platform. In a screenshot of the message Johnson posted from a different account he created after his ban (which was then suspended), Twitter cited its policy banning \"targeted abuse\" in its decision. \"Your account will not be restored,\" the notice concluded.\n\n\"Twitter doesn't seem to have a problem with people using their service to co-ordinate riots,\" Johnson wrote on his site, GotNews.com, in response to the ban. \"But they do have a problem with the kind of journalism I do.\"\n\nJohnson had a clear history of violating Twitter's rules against abuse and harassment, even back when the list of banned behaviours was much shorter than it is today. And many, including several of his targets, cheered his suspension as a long overdue intervention. But some writers and anti-censorship advocates noted at the time that the particular way this suspension played out raises some questions about how Twitter enforces its policies.\n\nOver at Slate, Amanda Hess suggested that the tweet that finally did in Johnson's Twitter days may have drawn such a dramatic response because of the prominence of the person it targeted. Noting that a memo from former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo once expressed concern about the effect rampant abuse was having on Twitter's \"core users,\" Hess noted, \"With 133,000 followers, DeRay McKesson is one of them.\"\n\n• George Zimmerman\n\nZimmerman, best known as the man who was acquitted of criminal wrongdoing for shooting to death Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, had made a second career as an online troll. After several major controversies about the content of his Twitter account, Twitter appeared to kick out Zimmerman for good in December, just after he posted a series of tweets containing seminude photographs of his ex-girlfriend, along with her contact information.\n\nUnlike Johnson, Zimmerman hasn't publicly stated that his ban was permanent, and Twitter doesn't confirm that sort of thing to journalists. But the fact that his account has been off-line for several months, combined with the severity of the rule violations the preceded his suspension, it seems likely that Zimmerman was permanently suspended.\n\nAt the time, Twitter directed us to their policy banning \"revenge porn\" in response to questions about Zimmerman's ban. The now-deleted tweets accused Zimmerman's ex of sleeping with a \"dirty Muslim\" and of stealing from him.\n\nTwitter's revenge porn policy bans users from posting \"nonpublic, personal phone numbers,\" of others, along with \"nonpublic, personal email addresses\" and \"intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent.\" Zimmerman appeared to violate all three of these prohibitions.\n\nThe tweets prompted speculation that Zimmerman might find himself in trouble with the law yet again in Florida, this time for violating the state's revenge porn law. But Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami and legislative and tech policy director of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, told us after Zimmerman's Twitter suspension that this was likely not the case. Basically, the photographs Zimmerman posted did not violate the state's narrow definition of \"nudity.\"\n\n\"Its possible,\" Franks said, \"that Zimmerman may have researched the law to make sure that he didn't violate it.\"\n\nWhile Zimmerman's account remains suspended, he has still been able to generate controversy on the social platform. His name trended on Twitter in May after he decided to auction off the gun he used to kill Martin.\n\n• Robert Stacy McCain\n\nTwitter permanently suspended the alt-right, anti-feminist writer Robert Stacy McCain in February at a moment when his cohorts were already highly suspicious of the social network. McCain has repeatedly questioned Twitter's explanation — sent to him in an email, which he posted to his blog — that he was suspended for inciting harassment.\n\nHis suspension became a rallying cry for those who believed a never-proven theory that Twitter was conspiring with feminist activists to censor conservatives. They started tweeting their outrage with the #freestacy hashtag, and then claimed that it, too, was being censored from Twitter's trending lists. Actor Adam Baldwin, likely the most famous supporter of Gamergate, quit Twitter briefly over the affair.\n\nTwitter said McCain was suspended for participating in \"targeted abuse,\" a rule that McCain sees as essentially meaningless. \"Anybody could be offended by anything,\" McCain told me in a lengthy, wide-ranging phone conversation in February, shortly after his suspension. \"The question is, who complained and why was it construed as targeting abuse?\"\n\nLike anyone else who is suspended permanently, McCain doesn't know for a fact which tweets were found in violation of Twitter's rules, but questioned generally whether he should be accountable if \"somebody that I retweeted, or someone that retweeted me, does something wrong.\"\n\nThe writer said he fundamentally disagrees with Twitter's approach to combating harassment in the first place. I asked McCain what he thought of Twitter's stated position that online harassment can have the effect of intimidating its victims into silence. He replied, \"That's crazy.\"\n\nMcCain, whose account was locked in the past for rule violations, has said repeatedly that he was doing nothing on Twitter to deserve a suspension. And because it became a big deal after the fact (once the tweets were already deleted from Twitter, along with his entire account) it's impossible to go back and look at the record of what he said before his suspension. That, perhaps, is why this case so intensely captured the support and imagination of users who felt Twitter was taking a stand against them for their conservative beliefs.\n\nWhen asked about the theory that Twitter was cracking down on conservative users in February, a spokesperson categorically denied it. \"Our rules outline conduct and content boundaries on Twitter,\" the statement reads. \"When abusive content is reported to us, we will suspend the account without regard for political ideology.\"\n\n• Azealia Banks\n\nAzealia Banks had a long history of picking fights on Twitter before her indefinite suspension from the site in May — to the point that some argued that her trolling had overshadowed her career as a rapper.\n\nHer Twitter beefs are well-documented in the music press and are often characterizedby homophobic slurs. Once she got into an extremely graphic and bizarre Twitter fight with former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, after apparently misreading a \"hoax\" article about Palin's views on slavery and believing it was real.\n\nBut the tweets that appear to have led to her suspension targeted singer Zayn Malik and a 14-year-old Disney star named Skai Jackson. The fight began with Banks accusing Malik of plagiarizing one of her music videos, and quickly escalated until Banks called Malik a \"curry-scented b--.\"\n\nWhen Jackson tweeted that \"Azealia Banks needs to simmer down a little,\" Banks replied that the teenager needed to \"grow some hips and start (her) menses.\"\n\nThe exact action — indefinite or permanent suspension — that Twitter took against Banks after that isn't clear. But her subsequent attempt to return to Twitter under a different handle and address the situation led to that account being suspended, too, suggesting that Twitter doesn't want the rapper to return at all.Before her second account was suspended, Banks tweeted that she believed Twitter suspended her because they \"have a problem with a black b--- speaking her mind but not isis accounts nazis child porn etc.\" She added: \"Something's wrong when a black woman's opinion calls for suspension where's @realDonaldTrump suspension?\"",

    "content": "China has warned that all trade talks between Beijing and Washington will be void if the US sets up trade sanctions.\n\nAfter talks between Vice Premier Liu He and US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, China said it was ready to boost imports from many countries.\n\nMr Ross's China visit comes days after Washington threatened to impose extra tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods.\n\nMeanwhile, G7 nations have hit out at the US over its new steel and aluminium import tariffs.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned a trade war could begin in \"a few days\".\n\nOn Saturday President Trump insisted on Twitter that the US had been \"ripped off by other countries for years on trade\".\n\nHe says steel tariffs will protect US steelmakers, which he says are vital to national security. Mr Trump has also complained about barriers US firms face in Europe and elsewhere.\n\n\"Time to get smart!\" he added.Trade sanctions: The basics\nWhat is a trade war? It's when countries attack each other's trade with taxes and quotas. One will raise tariffs, a type of tax, causing the other to respond, in a tit-for-tat escalation. This can hurt economies and lead to rising political tensions.\nWhat are tariffs? Taxes on products made abroad. In theory, taxing items coming into the country (imports) makes people less likely to buy them as they become more expensive. They're likely to buy cheaper local products instead, boosting your country's economy.\nWhat's a trade deficit? The difference between how much your country buys from another country, compared with how much you sell to that country. The US has a massive trade deficit with China. Last year, it stood at about $375bn.\nWhat are the Chinese saying?\nA statement released by the Chinese side at the talks with the US in Beijing said nothing specific about the outcome, and referred back to an agreement reached in Washington last month to increase the purchase of US goods and services.\n\n\"To implement the consensus reached in Washington, the two sides have had good communication in various areas such as agriculture and energy, and have made positive and concrete progress while relevant details are yet to be confirmed by both sides,\" the statement said.\n\nBut state news agency Xinhua carried a statement which warned against a trade war and said the two sides should meet each other half way.\n\n\"Reform and opening up and expanding domestic demand are China's national strategies. Our established rhythm will not change,\" it said.\n\n\"If the United States introduces trade sanctions including tariffs, all the economic and trade achievements negotiated by the two parties will be void.\"\n\nWhat is the US trying to do?\nThe Beijing talks were aimed at reducing the bilateral trade deficit. The US currently buys nearly four times as much from China as it sells to them.A White House statement last week, which took aim at years of \"unfair\" trade practices, warned the US would pursue 25% tariffs on $50bn (£37bn) worth of Chinese imports.\n\nThe tone of the statement suggested that China's concessions at last month's talks in Washington were not enough for the Trump administration, says BBC Asia Business correspondent Karishma Vaswani.\n\nAnalysts say that the statement could have been designed as a bargaining tactic aimed at increasing pressure on China ahead of Sunday's meeting, amid criticism at home that Mr Trump is going soft on China.\n\nNo joint statement was issued at the end of Sunday's meeting in Beijing, and there has been no response to the Chinese comments by the US side.\n\nWhat about the G7?\nAt a heated meeting in the Canadian ski resort of Whistler, the EU and Canada threatened to retaliate against tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, whose implementation Mr Ross announced on Thursday.\n\nBut US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin denied that the US had abandoned leadership in the global economy and said he had passed on the other countries' strong feelings to Mr Trump.There was no joint statement at the end of this meeting either, which the BBC's North America correspondent Chris Buckler says is a clear sign of discord.\n\nOur correspondent says acrimonious debate is likely to continue next weekend when the leaders of the G7 countries - including Mr Trump - meet for a summit in Quebec.\n\nCanada, Mexico and the EU together exported $23bn worth of steel and aluminium to the US in 2017 - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year.\n\nThe EU has responded to the US announcement with a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon.\n\nCanada plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on about $13bn worth of US exports from 1 July. Goods affected will include some American steel, as well as consumer products such as yoghurt, whiskey and coffee.",

    "content": "TRIESTE - Due poliziotti, l'agente scelto Pierluigi Rotta, 34 anni di Napoli e l'agente Matteo Demenego, 31 anni di Velletri, sono morti ieri pomeriggio a Trieste in una sparatoria in Questura. A sparare un rapinatore che avevano fermato e che era insieme al fratello. Secondo una nota della stessa Questura, \"i due fratelli erano stati accompagnati in Questura da personale delle Volanti dopo un'attività di ricerca del responsabile della rapina di uno scooter, avvenuta nelle prime ore del mattino. Per motivi in fase di accertamento - si legge nella nota - uno dei due ha distolto l'attenzione degli agenti e ha esploso a bruciapelo più colpi verso di loro. Entrambi hanno tentato di fuggire dalla Questura, ma sono stati fermati\".I due fratelli sono originari della Repubblica Dominicana. Si chiamano Alejandro Augusto Stephan Meran, di 29 anni e Carlysle Stephan Meran, di 32. A sparare ai due poliziotti è stato il primo, descritto come affetto da disagio psichico. In mattinata Alejandro Augusto Stephan Meran aveva rubato il motorino a una signora, facendola cadere. Si era però pentito e aveva chiamato il fratello per chiedergli consiglio. Quest'ultimo ha avvertito la polizia, ma una volta arrivati in Questura Alejandro ha chiesto di andare in bagno e, all'improvviso, ha sottratto due pistole agli agenti che ha poi ucciso sparando loro a bruciapelo.\n\nQuello che è certo è che Meran - che come il fratello non aveva precedenti e non era segnalato come soggetto pericoloso - è riuscito a sottrarre le due armi. Come abbia fatto sarà difficile ricostruirlo: alla scena non hanno assistito testimoni e la zona non è coperta da telecamere. Dopo aver sparato al primo poliziotto, Meran si incammina verso l'uscita e trova sulla sua strada il secondo agente. L'uomo spara ancora e quando il poliziotto cade in terra gli prende la pistola, strappandogli la fondina. A quel punto si avvicina all'uscita e ha un terzo conflitto a fuoco, con l'agente al corpo di guardia, che lo ferisce. Meran, dicono ancora le fonti, riesce comunque a uscire dall'edificio e qui viene bloccato dagli uomini della squadra mobile. Alejandro cerca di scappato ma viene inseguito dagli agenti e ferito all'inguine. Secondo un testimone, una volta rimasto a terra ha urlato: \"Non voglio l'ambulanza, portami via, scappiamo!\".\n\nDalla ricostruzione che sta emergendo sembra inoltre che il fratello, Carlysle Stephan Meran, non abbia avuto alcun ruolo nella sparatoria e, anzi, per paura si sia rifugiato nei sotterranei appena si è cominciato a sparare.\n\nLa sparatoria è avvenuta nella zona tra la via del Teatro Romano e via di Tor Bandena, nel centro del capoluogo giuliano. Il Piccolo riporta che i testimoni hanno parlato di numerosi colpi d'arma da fuoco che hanno seminato il panico tra la gente che era in strada. Sul posto è intervenuta un'ambulanza e la strada è stata chiusa al traffico, protetta da un cordone di sicurezza.\nIl titolare di un locale della zona ha riferito di aver sentito spari provenienti dall'interno della questura e di aver visto pochi istanti dopo un giovane uscire di corsa con in mano un'arma. Quest'ultimo avrebbe provato ad aprire un'auto della polizia parcheggiata lì davanti, ma inutilmente. Subito dopo sono giunti alcuni agenti che lo hanno bloccato.\n\nUn'altra testimone ha raccontato: \"È accaduto tutto alle 16.54, ho sentito sei spari e mi sono chiusa dentro il negozio. Poi i poliziotti urlavano 'mani in alto e faccia a terra' e ho sentito altri spari\".\n\n\"Ho aspettato dieci minuti e mi sono affacciata: ho visto una persona a terra - racconta ancora la donna - con una pistola accanto e tre poliziotti che entravano di corsa in questura alla ricerca di un altro uomo. Ferma in mezzo alla strada un'auto aperta. Poi siamo dovuti rientrare, mentre sul posto sono arrivate tre ambulanze. Ora è tutto transennato\".\n\nIl presidente della Repubblica Sergio Mattarella ha inviato al capo della polizia Franco Gabrielli un messaggio: \"Ho appreso con profonda tristezza la notizia della barbara uccisione dell'agente scelto Matteo De Menego e dell'agente Pierluigi Rotta, feriti mortalmente presso la Questura di Trieste mentre erano impegnati in una operazione di servizio. In questa dolorosa circostanza, desidero esprimere a lei ed alla Polizia di Stato la mia solidale vicinanza, rinnovando i sentimenti di considerazione e riconoscenza per il quotidiano impegno degli operatori della Polizia al servizio dei cittadini. La prego di far pervenire ai familiari degli agenti le espressioni della mia commossa partecipazione al loro dolore\".\n\nIl sindaco di Trieste, Roberto Dipiazza, ha dichiarato il lutto cittadino. La ministra dell'Interno, Luciana Lamorgese, e il capo della polizia Franco Gabrielli sono corsi subito a Trieste, dove sono arrivati in serata.\n\nDomani sera è prevista a Trieste una fiaccolata spontanea che partirà nei pressi della Questura dove un dominicano, entrato con suo fratello dopo essere stato fermato per un furto, ha sottratto la pistola a un agente ed ha fatto fuoco, uccidendo due poliziotti prima di essere a sua volta ferito e quindi fermato.",

    "content": "South Africa and India renewed their bid to waive rules of the WTO’s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement, a move that could allow generic or other manufacturers to make more vaccines.\n\nSouth Africa argued the current TRIPS system does not work, pointing to the failure to secure life-saving medicines during the HIV/AIDS pandemic that had cost at least 11 million African lives.\n\nMedecins Sans Frontieres in October put together a letter signed by over 375 civil society organisations supporting the waiver.\n\nThe South Africa and India proposal was backed by dozens of largely developing countries at the WTO, but opposed by Western countries, including Britain, Switzerland, EU nations and the United States, which have large domestic pharmaceutical industries.\n\nIndia is a major manufacturer of generics, although many of the largest generic companies are based in Western and developed countries, including Viatris, Sandoz and Teva.\n\nWestern nations argue protecting intellectual property rights encouraged research and innovation and that suspending those rights would not result in a sudden surge of vaccine supply.In its eighth discussion on the topic since it was first raised in October, the WTO’s TRIPS Council spent three hours debating, but failed to agree. Proposals need backing by a consensus of the WTO’s 164 members to pass.\n\nThey did at least agree to discuss the matter twice again in April before the next scheduled TRIPS Council meeting on June 8-9.\n\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala, who became WTO director-general on March 1, called the intensifying TRIPS discussions “vitally important,” but said governments and businesses needed to act now to increase production, especially in emerging markets.\n\nShe said in a speech on Tuesday that manufacturers should come together with bodies such as the World Health Organization and vaccines alliance GAVI, whose board she used to chair, and business associations to look into options.\n\n“We must make sure that in the end we deliver so that the millions of people who are waiting for us with bated breath know that we are working on concrete solutions,” the former Nigerian finance and foreign minister said.",

    "content": "An historic assault is being waged on the Amazon rainforest and the indigenous people who have called it home for thousands of years as the world’s population takes shelter from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDeforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose more than 50% in the first three months of 2020 compared to the same three-month period last year, according to preliminary satellite data released by the Brazilian Space Agency’s deforestation monitoring system.Even before the pandemic struck, scientists warned that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s development-friendly policies could transform the world’s largest rainforest into a drier, savannah-like landscape. Once this “tipping point” is crossed, scientists said, the ecosystem could begin emitting more greenhouse gases than it captures, effectively turning a vital tool in the fight against climate change into another source of harmful emissions.\n\nBrazil’s indigenous reserves hold some of the most pristine sections of the rainforest in the world and have long been targeted by illegal logging and mining operations seeking to exploit their natural resources. Since the outbreak started, however, Brazil’s environmental agency has scaled back more enforcement measures, leaving the forest and its indigenous tribes even more vulnerable to a litany of deadly threats.\n\n“Our territory keeps being invaded by loggers and hunters,” Laercio Guajajara, a member of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao, told ABC News. Even in the midst of the global health crisis, he said, there were “still a lot of invasions.”Now, those so-called invaders could leave more than just environmental destruction in their wake.\n\n“We are desperate,” Andre Karipuna, a 27-year-old member of the tiny Karipuna tribe of in the state of Rondonia, told the Environmental Justice Foundation. “The Karipuna are a small isolated community and just one infected person could rapidly pass the virus on to the whole tribe.”\n\nBrazil’s indigenous tribe’s have already been under increased pressure since Bolsonaro took office in 2019. He immediately began slashing funding and enforcement at FUNAI, the country’s department of indigenous affairs that provides essential services to indigenous communities across the nation. In July 2019, he appointed a federal police officer with connections to agribusiness to head the agency.\n\nSome tribal leaders have taken defense of their lands into their own hands. Last summer, ABC News was granted rare access to one such group, the Guajajara tribe’s “Guardians,” embedding within their ragtag convoy of trucks and motorcycles during a four-day patrol over several dozen miles of dense terrain.\n\nWith cameras rolling, the “Guardians” pursued an illegal logging operation deep into the jungle, employing satellite imagery, intelligence gathering and old-fashioned tracking along the way. The resulting documentary, “Guardians of the Amazon” captured a complex struggle, featuring powerful industrial interests, complicit tribal villagers, indifferent government agencies — and an ever-present fear of violent reprisals.Now, in the midst of the pandemic, the Brazilian government is again advancing controversial legislation regarding indigenous lands, potentially compounding tribes' vulnerability to invasion and infection.\n\nIn April, Bolsonaro's indigenous affairs agency, FUNAI, passed the controversial law IN 09. The new rule prevents long-held indigenous lands waiting for official demarcation from being labelled as \"indigenous\" in the land registry as they wait.\n\nEnvironmental groups allege the new law provides a route for those who illegally occupy indigenous lands to claim the land is not indigenous. According to Greenpeace, the seemingly obscure rule change will have drastic consequences for the nearly one third of indigenous lands still awaiting official designation by the government.\n\nAnother controversial rule, Provisional Measure (MP) 910, first decreed by Bolsonaro in December 2019, is now being considered for permanent law. The measure allows those who illegally deforested and occupied protected federal lands before December 2018 to purchase the property at reduced prices.\n\nCritics allege the rule is a reward for illegal land grabbers and criminal gangs who seized protected lands from indigenous tribes, and an analysis by the not-for-profit organization IMAZON found the measure could lead to the added deforestation of up to 16,000 square kilometers of rainforest by 2027.The Bolsonaro administration denies the new land ownership rules would facilitate and legitimize land-grabbing, arguing new landowners will be required to preserve up to 80% of their land and will only grant legal titles to those who occupied federal lands in a “tame and peaceful way for many years.” The measure could be passed by a virtual vote within a few weeks, without being subject to standard scrutiny, according to environmental groups.\n\nSince the enforcement rollbacks, reports of illegal logging and violent attacks across the region’s indigenous reserves have increased. Grave concern is widespread among indigenous tribes both large and small.\n\nIn early April, Indigenous leaders from the Yanomami reserve, the country’s largest, began reporting an increase in illegal gold mining during the pandemic. BBC Brasil published satellite photographs showing illegal miners moving into an area of the reserve where one isolated community lives. Some leaders reportedly blamed the invasions for the April 10th death of a 15-year-old boy who was the first among Yanomami known to die from the virus.\n\nThe Karipuna indigenous tribe of Rondonia -- one of the smallest and most vulnerable indigenous tribes in the country with less than 100 people – submitted a complaint to federal prosecutors on April 8th stating non-indigenous people were clearing inside their reserve.\n\n\"It is urgent that the authorities take surgical and structural measures to combat land grabbing underway [at the reserve]\" the complaint reads, demanding the identification, arrest, and withdrawal of the invaders.Some tribes are reporting an increase in land-use related bloodshed during the pandemic. On April 18th, a 33-year-old indigenous leader of the Uru-eu-wau-wau reserve in Rondonia was reportedly assassinated. The leader had been known for his outspoken criticism of illegal logging.\n\nAnd in March, Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao was killed by a shotgun-wielding assailant that has yet to be found, according to Amazon Watch. A teacher and longtime supporter of the Guajajara’s “Guardians of the Forest,” Zezico was reportedly gunned down while riding his motorcycle, becoming the fifth Guajajara murdered in as many months.\n\n“Indigenous lands are living a very difficult time,” Erival Guajajara, a 29-year-old member of the Guajajara told ABC News. “We are afraid for our lives because of our vulnerability.”",

Loss of lives has occurred due to a stampede,\" said a government statement published by state media earlier.\n\nMerera Gudina, chairman of the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress, told AFP there had been many fatalities.\n\n\"Bodies are being collected by the government. But what I hear from people on the ground is that the number of dead is more than one hundred,\" said Gudina.\n\nSunday's event quickly degenerated into violence, with protesters throwing stones and bottles and security forces responding with baton charges and tear gas grenades, with some reports of gunfire.\n\n'Days of rage'\n\nThe police action sent people fleeing in panic with many falling on top of each other into a ditch.\n\nPolice demanded that AFP's photographer leave the scene, where rubber bullets were seen strewn on the ground.\n\nOromo activists called for \"five days of rage\" to protest the deaths while a strong police presence was visible as the news of the day's events spread.\n\n\"This government is a dictatorship, there is no equality or freedom of speech. There is only TPLF. That's why we must protest today,\" said Mohamed Jafar, referring to the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front.\n\nIn 1991 the TPLF, then a rebel group, overthrew Mengistu Haile Mariam's dictatorship and now, as a political party, stands accused of monopolising power.\n\nEvery year millions of people in the Oromo region mark the Irreecha festival on the shores of Lake Harsadi, which they consider sacred.\n\nThe anti-government protests started in the central and western Oromo region in 2015 and spread in recent months to the northern Amhara region.\n\n\"For the last 25 years the Oromo people have been marginalised in many things. Today we come together as one to chant for our freedom,\" said one of the people at the festival, Habte Bulcha.\n\nTogether, Oromos and Amharas make up 60 percent of the population of the Horn of Africa nation and have become increasingly vocal in rejecting what they see as the disproportionate power wielded by the northern Tigrean minority in government and the security forces.\n\n(AFP)",

All schools previously received a 20-day waiver in order to reduce the amount of required in-person or remote instruction to 160 days.\n\nSchools will now have to provide only e-learning instruction until they either complete 160 instructional days or at least 20 additional days of remote learning between April 2 and the end of the school year. If a school completes the 20 days but falls short of the required 160 days, the Indiana Department of Education will waive the difference.\n\nSchools will be required to submit a continuous learning plan by April 17.\n\n“The department is committed to working with schools to make sure that those plans have some type of guidelines for you to follow, but it also signals to families, students, and our policy makers what instruction is happening across the state and what that looks like,” said McCormick.\n\nMcCormick said one of the department’s goals is to get graduates across the stage, saying that all high school seniors on track to graduate before school buildings were closed on March 19 will be provided with the flexibility they need to earn an Indiana diploma.\n\nSuperintendent of Indianapolis Public Schools Aleesia Johnson said Thursday afternoon she supported the decision to keep schools closed for the rest of the year in response to the public health crisis.\n\n“We’ll continue working to serve our students and families well,” Johnson said on Twitter.",

Some leaders reportedly blamed the invasions for the April 10th death of a 15-year-old boy who was the first among Yanomami known to die from the virus.\n\nThe Karipuna indigenous tribe of Rondonia -- one of the smallest and most vulnerable indigenous tribes in the country with less than 100 people – submitted a complaint to federal prosecutors on April 8th stating non-indigenous people were clearing inside their reserve.\n\n\"It is urgent that the authorities take surgical and structural measures to combat land grabbing underway [at the reserve]\" the complaint reads, demanding the identification, arrest, and withdrawal of the invaders.Some tribes are reporting an increase in land-use related bloodshed during the pandemic. On April 18th, a 33-year-old indigenous leader of the Uru-eu-wau-wau reserve in Rondonia was reportedly assassinated. The leader had been known for his outspoken criticism of illegal logging.\n\nAnd in March, Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao was killed by a shotgun-wielding assailant that has yet to be found, according to Amazon Watch. A teacher and longtime supporter of the Guajajara’s “Guardians of the Forest,” Zezico was reportedly gunned down while riding his motorcycle, becoming the fifth Guajajara murdered in as many months.\n\n“Indigenous lands are living a very difficult time,” Erival Guajajara, a 29-year-old member of the Guajajara told ABC News. “We are afraid for our lives because of our vulnerability.”",

    "content": "The United Nations chief urged Japan and other wealthy nations on Thursday to give up their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels and commit to investments in green energy as they recover from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made the appeal in an address to an online climate conference hosted by Japan.\n\nGuterres noted that many countries are using the opportunity of the pandemic to double down on green energy and other initiatives, aiming to attain a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average.\n\n“We are facing two critical crises, COVID and climate change,” he said in pre-recorded remarks. He said he hoped the meeting would “leave future generations with the hope that this moment is the true turning point for people and the planet.”\n\nA major U.N. Climate Change Conference due to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, this November was postponed due to the pandemic. Dubbed COP26, it is to be held there in early November 2021.\n\nJapan’s Environment Ministry has led an initiative called the Online Platform for Sustainable and Resilient Recovery from COVID-19, or “Platform for Redesign 2020.” Its website says it is a hub that collates countries’ climate and other environmental policies and actions that are planned and implemented in the context of recovery from COVID-19.\n\nGuterres noted that Japan’s advanced technology in many fields should make it a leader in shifting to renewable energy and urged it to stop financing construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe top priorities, he said, are prioritizing “green” jobs, ending subsidies for use of fossil fuels and taking energy and climate change issues into account in all decisions.\n\n“Clean energy delivers more jobs, cleaner air, better health and stronger economic growth,” Guterres said.\n\n“It makes no sense economically to burn money on coal plants that will soon become stranded assets,” he added. “There is simply no rational case for coal power in any investment plan.”\n\nJapan scaled back its ambitions for shifting to renewable energy after the massive March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown disasters in the northeastern Tohoku region led it to close down its nuclear power plants for safety overhauls.\n\nSome have restarted but most have not. In the meantime, the country has made up for lost power generating capacity by boosting use of coal, oil and gas, ramping up use of solar power and reducing waste.\n\nThe government also has sought to export its expertise and technology by helping to finance construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\nGuterres said the goals of halving global emissions by 2030 and achieving “carbon neutrality” by 2050 — key to limiting global warming — were achievable, “but we are currently off track.”He urged countries participating in the conference to come up with more ambitious plans and long-term strategies before COP26 next year.\n\nIn comments delivered on the website Platform for Redesign 2020, Japan’s environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, said the endeavor aims to help countries “redesign their economic and social systems in this time of dual crises.”\n\nThe pandemic has slowed most activities, he noted, but “climate change gives us no time to waste.”\n\n“Our task is not to return to the pre-pandemic world, but to build back better,” he said.",

    "content": "PARIS — The United Nations cultural agency UNESCO on Tuesday re-elected France’s Audrey Azoulay as its director-general for a second mandate, with the former French culture minister hailing a new confidence and unity in the organization.\n\nUNESCO had been riven by divisions when Azoulay took office in 2017 with both Israel and the United States exiting the agency over accusations of anti-Israeli bias.\n\nUnchallenged, Azoulay won her new mandate at UNESCO’s general conference with 155 votes in favor, just nine against and one abstention.\n\n“I see this result as a sign of regained unity within our organization. Over the last four years, we have been able to restore confidence in UNESCO, and in some respects this has also been about restoring UNESCO’s confidence in itself,” she said.\n\n“We regained serenity by reducing the political tensions that stood in our way and by looking for common positions on subjects that were divisive in the past,” she added.UNESCO, which in 2020-21 received total funding of $1.4 billion from compulsory member contributions and donations, has been at the forefront of high-profile projects such as rebuilding the old city of Mosul in Iraq and schools in the Lebanese capital Beirut damaged by the August 2020 blast.\n\nAzoulay’s greatest challenge for her second four-year term will be seeking to woo Israel and the US back into the organization, which oversees the coveted World Heritage label for humanity’s most cherished sites worldwide.\n\nA source close to Azoulay, who asked not to be named, told AFP in the run-up to the conference that there were “positive signs” that the two countries could be considering a return.For some, the return of the US would be a welcome balance to the growing importance and influence of China which now makes up over 15 percent of the total compulsory budget contributions.",

    "content": "According to Jaani, Estonia has assessed the risk that it will become a transit channel for illegal immigrants heading to the Nordic countries as the biggest risk for it at this point.\n\n\"Fortunately, this threat has not materialized so far,\" the Center minister said. \n\nHe said that five illegal immigrants who have entered EU territory from Belarus have been caught in Estonia, two of whom have already been sent back to the country of origin, Iraq. One will be sent back on Thursday.\n\n\"It has been very easy for us to send these people back to Iraq because they have chosen to return voluntarily. One, who had come from Russia, we sent back to Russia, and Russia kindly admitted that person,\" Jaani said. \n\nHe added that proceedings regarding two persons were still underway at the detention center.\n\nAccording to Jaani, the attention of the police is focused on EU internal borders, especially the Tallinn passenger port, as it can be believed that the aim of illegals is to reach the Nordic countries.\n\n\"But we also perform activities on the southern border. However, no changes have been registered on the Estonian-Russian border so far,\" the minister added.\n\nDefense minister: Migrants also causing problems in Belarus\n\nMinister of Defense Kalle Laanet (Reform) said Belarusian regime leader Alexander Lukashenko might give Poland a \"present\" for its National Independence Day (on November 11 - ed).\n\n\"Migrants are also causing issues in Belarus. Iraqi authorities are prepared to organize return flights, but migrants have no interest in flying back. The Belarusian border guards are supported by the internal forces of Belarus, causing confusion on the Polish-Belarusian border,\" Laanet said.\n\nHe noted that Baltic defense ministers expressed support for Poland on Wednesday. \"I spoke to the Polish defense minister today, who was thankful for our assistance. I confirmed to him that we are willing to assist in the form of real action,\" Laanet added.\n\nKristian Jaani said Poland has not yet called for Estonia's help and Estonia's goal is to solve crises where they have developed. \"We are prepared to help countries suffering under the pressure of migration through the EU and directly,\" the interior minister said.Jaani: Eastern border construction to be completed earlier than expected\n\nThe construction of the Estonian-Russian border has progressed very well and the structures are likely to be completed earlier than planned, Jaani said at the press conference.\n\n\"The physical border fence is already in place in the places where experts identified the highest risks of illegal border crossing. This is 23 kilometers upwards from the three-way meeting point in the southeast corner,\" Jaani said.\n\nBy three-way meeting point, the minister meant the point where the borders Estonia, Latvia and Russia meet. Jaani said that construction is also progressing in the next sections of the border, making up 39 kilometers in total.\n\n\"This means that work is in progress on around 63 kilometers. These are covered by valid construction contracts and work is in progress,\" Jaani said. \n\nThe Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) has started negotiations to speed up the construction of the border facilities under existing terms and conditions. \n\n\"We have also brought forward several procurements concerning the construction of the border, by up to six months. The aim is to speed up the construction of the eastern border, and we have also sped up procurements of surveillance equipment,\" the minister said.\n\nThe Ministry of the Interior also has agreements with the Ministry of Defense for the event that it becomes necessary to set up temporary barriers at the border.\n\n\"These critical locations are known to us and we can already proactively take temporary barriers where they may be needed,\" Jaani added.Prime minister: Estonia's security starts from Poland, Lithuania, Latvia\n\nPrime Minister Kaja Kallas (Reform) said Estonia is deeply concerned about the situation on the Polish-Belarusian border and it is the state's position that Estonia's security starts from Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.\n\n\"Therefore, it is extremely important to support Poland in every way possible, and we have raised this issue in the UN Security Council, which will convene to discuss the matter today,\" Kallas said at the government's press conference on Thursday.\n\nThe prime minister said that she has also communicated with her Polish counterpart. \"Poland has requested political support, specifically, and we are providing it at various levels,\" she said.\n\nKallas added that she was pleased to observe the president of the European Commission express her support to Poland and clearly state that this is not a migration crisis but a hybrid attack against the European Union.\n\n\"What's also important for Estonia is that in disputes on whether Europe should fund the construction of EU's external border, the president of the European Council said on Wednesday that physical funding should come from the budget of the European Union,\" Kallas said.\n\nA decision is expected to be delivered at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on Monday regarding a supplementary sanction against the Belarusian dictator, the prime minister said.",

    "content": "(CNN)Japan's Emperor Naruhito has officially proclaimed his enthronement, in a ritual-bound, centuries-old ceremony attended by more than a hundred dignitaries from around the world.\n\nThe head of state began his reign in May, after his father, Akihito, became the first emperor to abdicate in 200 years. But on Tuesday, Naruhito, 59, announced his change in status to the world, in an elaborate series of rituals known as \"Sokui no Rei\" at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.As the ceremony began, purple curtains were pulled back to reveal Naruhito and his wife, Empress Masako, 55, sitting in two ornately decorated thrones.Naruhito wore a rust-colored robe -- just as his father did during his own enthronement in 1990 -- while Masako wore a patterned, white robe and topped her traditional hairstyle with a gilded headpiece. The brother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito, 83-year-old Prince Hitachi, watched the proceedings from a wheelchair.\nReading from a large piece of paper, Naruhito then proclaimed his enthronement before an audience of the imperial family.\"I pledge hereby that I shall act according to the Constitution and fulfill my responsibility as the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people of Japan, while always wishing for the happiness of the people and the peace of the world, turning my thoughts to the people and standing by them,\" Naruhito said.\n\"I sincerely hope that our country, through our people's wisdom and unceasing efforts, achieves further development and contributes to the friendship and peace of the international community and the welfare and prosperity of humankind.\"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stood before Naruhito's throne, and read a speech. He then bowed deeply and yelled \"Long live the emperor!\"\nAs Naruhito ascended the throne, boxes were placed next to him that are believed to contain a sword and ancient jewel that, according to legend, date back to the mythical forefather of Japan's first emperor, Jimmu, who ruled almost 2,700 years ago. Along with a fabled octagonal mirror, they form Japan's royal regalia, or the Three Sacred Treasures. The sword and the jewel are so sacred that they've never been seen in public.\nNaruhito will also receive felicitations from local -- and international -- representatives. Earlier in the day, Naruhito donned a white robe to pray at Shinto shrines in the Imperial palace.A number of high-profile guests were in attendance, including Britain's Prince Charles and embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon was also on the guest list, despite an ongoing trade spat between South Korea and Japan.\nThe enthronement ceremony will be followed by an imperial banquet on Tuesday night.Celebrations tempered\nThe high-profile occasion comes as Japan reels from Typhoon Hagibis -- one of the strongest storms to hit the country in years. The typhoon left dozens dead and caused extensive damage after it smashed into the country earlier this month.\nThe devastation prompted the palace to postpone a 4.6-kilometer (2.9-mile) public parade from the Imperial Palace to Akasaka Palace until November.\nOn Friday, the government announced that about 550,000 petty criminals will be pardoned to mark the emperor's enthronement.Chrysanthemum traditions\nNaruhito -- whose name means \"a man who will acquire heavenly virtues\" -- became the 126th Emperor of Japan in May, the latest in an unbroken line that stretches back 14 centuries.\nIn this handout image provided by Imperial Household Agency, New Japanese Emperor Naruhito delivers his first speech after ascending the throne during the enthronement ceremony at the Imperial Palace on May 1, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan.\nNaruhito's ascension signaled the start of the \"Reiwa\" era. Each emperor's reign is marked by their era name, Naruhito's era name was adapted from an 8th century anthology of classic poetry and means \"beautiful harmony.\"\nThe role of Japan's emperor has changed significantly since Naruhito's grandfather, Emperor Hirohito, sat on the throne. Once considered the living embodiment of gods, the emperor has become a largely symbolic figure.\nUnlike other monarchs, Naruhito is a symbol of the state rather than the head of state, and the Japanese emperor wields no political power.\nNaruhito took the throne after his father, Akihito, became the first emperor to abdicate the Chrysanthemum Throne in modern history. In addition to being the first in centuries to abdicate, Akihito was the first Japanese Emperor to marry a non-royal speak to his subjects live on television and to be hands-on in raising his children.\nNaruhito, who became the first Japanese royal to study abroad, has pledged to continue his father's legacy and work to break down the barriers between the emperor and his subjects.\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correctly identify the brother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito.",

He claimed that a journalist had collected the video clip from the mobile phone of Moazzem and spread it on social media. Therefore, his client has not committed any offence, the lawyer said.After hearing the arguments, the HC bench made the observation about journalists.\n\nThe bench also refused to grant bail to Moazzem as there is a specific allegation against him that he recorded and circulated Nusrat's statement without her permission.\n\nIt kept the bail petition stand over (waiting for hearing) for the next three months, Deputy Attorney General Md Rezaul Karim told The Daily Star.He said Moazzem sought bail from the HC on the ground that he has been in jail for a long time since June 16, 2019 in connection with the case.\n\nOn November 29, 2019, a Dhaka court sentenced Moazzem to eight years' rigorous imprisonment for the said offence.\n\nNusrat, a student of Sonagazi Islamia Senior Fazil Madrasa in Feni, was set on fire on April 6, 2019 allegedly for refusing to withdraw a sexual assault case filed against the madrasa's principal Siraj Ud Doula.

    "content": "OTTAWA -- The federal government is easing the current cross-border travel policies on family reunification, expanding who will be allowed into Canada while also boosting monitoring for travellers entering the country.\n\nWhile the Canadian border is set to remain closed for another month at least to all non-essential travel, changes are coming to allow more extended family members into Canada on compassionate grounds, as well as allowing international students to enter the country under certain criteria.\n\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Marco Mendicino, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair and Health Minister Patty Hajdu made the announcement about updated border measures and travel regulations on Friday, stating that compassion is needed in light of the worsening spread in some regions of Canada that will likely lead to renewed lockdown measures.\"We needed to take these steps, given that this is not a short term problem,\" said Hajdu. \"This disease is not going away any time soon.\"\n\nAs of Oct. 8, extended family members of Canadian citizens and Canadian permanent residents, including those in an exclusive dating relationship of at least one year and their dependent children, as well as adult children, grandchildren, siblings and grandparents can come to Canada.\n\nIn the case of long-term but unmarried couples who do not share an address, they will need to provide a notarized declaration about their relationship.\n\nAlso able to enter the country as of Oct. 8 will be non-relative foreign nationals under compassionate reasons in specific circumstances, such as a close friend experiencing a life-threatening illness, critical injury or death, with the potential for limited release from quarantine to visit the injured or dying loved one.\n\n\"These situations could include being with someone you love to say goodbye at the end of their lives, or attending a funeral, or end of life ceremony… The decision to allow someone to end their quarantine early will be coordinated with the provincial or territorial government,\" Hajdu said.Starting Oct. 20, international students who are attending a learning institution that has a COVID-19 readiness plan in place that's been cleared by provincial or territorial health authorities will also be able to enter Canada.\n\nThe federal government says more detailed information about who can qualify for the new entry allowance will be available on the government's website next week, but it will include each traveller needing to apply for and be issued a travel authorization before coming to Canada.\n\nTravellers entering Canada will still need to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival unless specifically granted an exemption, and plan to stay in the country for at least 15 days.\n\n\"These are the relationships that are helping us to get through these unprecedented times... At the same time, many families and loved ones have been kept apart, and are separated from their Canadian relatives,\" Mendicino said. \"While the travel restrictions we've put into place have been difficult, the protections at the border are helping to keep us safe through the pandemic.\"\n\nNEW MONITORING MEASURES\nWhile the government will soon be allowing more people into Canada, it's also enhancing the current monitoring measures in place to make sure everyone is following their mandatory quarantine orders.\n\nSoon, 190 public health officers will be deployed to borders across the country and the Public Health Agency of Canada will be adding on more staff to call travellers who are quarantining to check in on them.\n\nAccording to the government, nearly one million contacts have been made since the beefed-up border measures first went into place to try to slow the spread of COVID-19 in March. Failure to comply with the national quarantine law could result in a fine or jail time, depending on the severity of the situation.\n\nAs well, the Public Health Agency of Canada is sending new digital portals for travellers to share their personal and contact information, including through the ArriveCAN app, so data can be transmitted to provinces and territories for further follow-up.\n\n\"Any individual who cannot be reached… or if there is a suspicion that someone is not currently complying with the quarantine requirements, local law enforcement follows up and they have the full authority to issue fines and undertake enforcement, as is necessary,\" Blair said.\n\nTravellers flying to Canada have to pass a health check before boarding their flight, and any foreign national showing signs or symptoms of COVID-19 are not allowed to enter the country.\n\nTRAVEL CASES 'TINY FRACTION': PM\nAsked about the incoming policy change ahead of the announcement, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government's top priority remains keeping Canadians safe.\n\n\"From the very beginning, our priority has been quite simple: Making sure that Canadians are protected from COVID-19 and that has meant taking strong actions at the border and continually looking how we can improve our actions to prevent importation of COVID-19,\" Trudeau said.\n\nHe went on to say that community transmission is the biggest driver of new cases, whereas the importation of cases from outside of Canada is a \"tiny fraction\" of the source of the virus' spread.\n\n\"What we're doing is working and we need to continue it, however, we can always look at ways to improve our measures while keeping Canadians safe and to do a better job of understanding the heart-wrenching stories of families divided, of compassionate cases that should be given flexibility, that wouldn't endanger Canadian safety,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThe ministers doubled down on this position, stating that travel is not the reason for the ongoing spread of the virus within Canada.\n\nBlair said that between two and three per cent of COVID-19 cases in Canada have been tied to travel.\n\nConservative immigration critic Raquel Dancho said that the policy change is a “welcome relief for many Canadians” but comes too late for some.\n\n“We will be closely monitoring the situation and are ready to sound the alarm if the government’s new process for reunifying families is unreasonably slow or ineffective,” she said in a statement.FAMILIES' PLEAS HEARD\nAs of June 9, foreign nationals who are immediate family members of either Canadian citizens or permanent residents were permitted to enter Canada to be reunited, under a limited exemption to the current border restrictions. This has allowed both foreign and cross-border Canada-U.S. families to reunite under certain stipulations, including parents, spouses, common-law partners, dependent children and their children.\n\nHowever, many other families remained separated by the border restrictions including non-married couples. People in that predicament have been putting considerable political and public pressure on politicians and policymakers to further ease up on the rules.\n\nOnce such couple—Ontario woman Sarah Campbell and her fiancé Jacob Taylor—got a special mention from Mendicino during Friday's announcement. Campbell is battling cancer and Taylor has been unable to travel to Canada from the U.K. to be with her during her treatments. The couple was set to be married in Canada in June, but they postponed their wedding when the pandemic hit and Taylor was stuck overseas.\n\n\"I know you've waited a long time for today,\" Mendicino said.\n\nThough, the minister couldn't say whether an early exemption to these coming policy updates would be made in the case of Charie Santiago, a British Columbia woman who is in palliative care for ovarian and uterine cancer.\n\nHer younger sister and best friend April lives in the Philippines and has been unable to visit because of the current travel restrictions.\n\n\"My heart goes out to everybody who is separated right now… it's our commitment to try and get these processes in place as quickly as possible, so that we can reunite as many families as possible… But at the same time protecting the health and safety of Canadians,\" Mendicino said.",

    "content": "LONDON/BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday said it would slap 10% tariffs on European-made Airbus AIR.PA planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies, and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies.The announcement came after the World Trade Organization gave Washington a green light to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually in the long-running case, a move that threatens to ignite a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war.\n\nThe measures would follow tariffs levied by the United States and China on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods in their more than year-old trade war.\n\nThe U.S. trade representative's target list for EU tariffs, set to take effect on Oct. 18, includes large Airbus planes made in France, Britain, Germany and Spain - the four Airbus consortium countries. But no tariffs will be imposed on EU-made aircraft parts used in Airbus' Alabama assembly operations or those used by rival U.S. planemaker Boeing Co BA.N, safeguarding U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n\n“Finally, after 15 years of litigation, the WTO has confirmed that the United States is entitled to impose countermeasures in response to the EU’s illegal subsidies,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.\n\n“We expect to enter into negotiations with the European Union aimed at resolving this issue in a way that will benefit American workers,” Lighthizer added.\n\nThe tariffs heavily target the four Airbus consortium countries, including Spanish olives, British sweaters and woollens, and German tools and coffee, as well as British whisky and French wine. Cheese from nearly every EU country will be hit with the 25% tariffs, but Italian wine and olive oil were spared, along with European chocolate.\n\nThe size and scope of the tariffs were reduced considerably from a $25 billion list floated by Washington earlier this year that included helicopters, major aircraft components, seafood, luxury goods and other big-ticket categories that were excluded from Wednesday’s announcement.\n\nOne person familiar with the case said the USTR was deliberately not using the full extent of WTO-approved retaliation to coax the EU to the negotiating table.But it came with an explicit warning.\n\n“The U.S. has the authority to increase the tariffs at any time, or change the products affected. USTR will continually re-evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the EU,” the USTR said.\n\nNEW TRADE WAR FRONT\nThe USTR has sought WTO ratification of its tariff list by Oct. 14. The duties could come into force just three days after a scheduled Oct. 15 tariff increase on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30% from 25%.\n\nAs Washington and Beijing try to ease their bitter 15-month trade war, the U.S.-EU trade spat looks set to worsen.\n\nAirbus spokesman Clay McConnell said the France-based planemaker was evaluating the list and its possible consequences in “close collaboration with the European Commission.”\n\nThe WTO, he said, in coming months would grant the EU authority to impose tariffs on U.S. goods over its findings of illegal subsidies for Boeing from Washington state that could equal or exceed the U.S. tariffs.\n\n“Airbus considers that the only way to prevent the negative effects that these countermeasures would create will be for the U.S. and EU to find a resolution to this long-running dispute through a negotiated settlement before the tariffs become effective,” he said.\n\n\nCHEAP LOANS\nIn their decision, WTO arbitrators said Boeing had lost the equivalent of $7.5 billion a year in sales and disruption to deliveries of some of its largest aircraft because of cheap European government loans to Airbus.\n\nThe decision, confirming a figure reported by Reuters last week, allows Washington to target the same value of EU goods but bars any retaliation against European financial services.\n\nAt list prices from $92 million for an A319 jetliner to some $366.5 million for an A350-1000 widebody, the 10% Airbus tariff could impose severe financial burdens on U.S. airline customers. Delta Air Lines DAL.N said it has about 170 Airbus planes on order that could be affected.“Aircraft are significant purchases requiring long-lead times for production - often years in advance,” Delta said in a statement. “Imposing tariffs on aircraft that U.S. companies have already committed to will inflict serious harm on U.S. airlines, the millions of Americans they employ and the traveling public.”\n\nBroad selling amid worries over slowing global growth that punished European stocks earlier on Wednesday accelerated as the ruling revived worries about damage to the already-ailing European economy. The pan European STOXX 600 index .STOXX finished down 2.7%, its worst day since December 2018. Airbus shares closed down 2%.\n\nWall Street’s main indexes suffered their sharpest one-day declines in nearly six weeks on Wednesday after employment and manufacturing data suggested the U.S.-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the U.S. economy.\n\nWAR OF ATTRITION\nAirbus and Boeing, the world’s two largest planemakers, have waged a war of attrition over subsidies at the WTO since 2004 in a dispute that has tested the trade policeman’s influence and is expected to set the tone for competition from would-be rivals from China.\n\nThe WTO had already found that both Airbus and Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in the world’s largest corporate trade dispute. The global trade body is due to decide early next year on the level of annual tariffs the EU can impose on U.S. imports.\n\nWhile the level of tariffs amounts to less than three days’ worth of trade between Europe and the United States, importers led by U.S. airlines that buy Airbus jets have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the U.S. economy.\n\nEU manufacturers are already facing U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to penalize EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.\n\nThe Trump administration believes tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to U.S. products.",

No one, except for very few, came to work. Since 6 November, when we closed again after the initial reopening on 1 June, all the art restorers and all the personnel who keep the Museum going came to work” respecting the rules and precautions to safeguard health.\n\n“Editorial work never stopped; all departmental research activity, restoration activity, construction sites and laboratories are up and running,” she said.\n\nIn a sense, Jatta revealed that she, like other directors of international museums, has taken the opportunity in a time in which exhibitions and events are suspended, “to focus on the collections, on the maintenance of exhibition spaces and deposits, on the catalogue, on research and publications.\"\n\nBarbara Jatta concluded expressing her hope that very soon the Museums will be able to open their doors to the public, a reality that depends on decisions to be taken by the Italian government in the coming days and weeks.",

All schools previously received a 20-day waiver in order to reduce the amount of required in-person or remote instruction to 160 days.\n\nSchools will now have to provide only e-learning instruction until they either complete 160 instructional days or at least 20 additional days of remote learning between April 2 and the end of the school year. If a school completes the 20 days but falls short of the required 160 days, the Indiana Department of Education will waive the difference.\n\nSchools will be required to submit a continuous learning plan by April 17.\n\n“The department is committed to working with schools to make sure that those plans have some type of guidelines for you to follow, but it also signals to families, students, and our policy makers what instruction is happening across the state and what that looks like,” said McCormick.\n\nMcCormick said one of the department’s goals is to get graduates across the stage, saying that all high school seniors on track to graduate before school buildings were closed on March 19 will be provided with the flexibility they need to earn an Indiana diploma.\n\nSuperintendent of Indianapolis Public Schools Aleesia Johnson said Thursday afternoon she supported the decision to keep schools closed for the rest of the year in response to the public health crisis.\n\n“We’ll continue working to serve our students and families well,” Johnson said on Twitter.",

In the post-independence period, the country endured despotism and near economic collapse. The human rights abuses of several Ugandan governments strained U.S. relations with Uganda.\n\nPresident Museveni came to power in 1986, after decades of internal strife. Under Museveni, Uganda has experienced relative political stability, democratic progress, and economic growth. The country has made strides in reducing HIV/AIDS, experienced economic growth, and stabilized its north, where the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) operated for 20 years. Uganda faces numerous challenges, however, including population growth, power and infrastructure constraints, corruption, underdeveloped democratic institutions, and human rights deficits.\n\nUganda is a key U.S. strategic partner, particularly through its contribution to the African Union Mission in Somalia. In addition, Uganda and other governments of the region, under the leadership of the African Union and with the support of the United States, have made progress in weakening the LRA and reducing its threat to central Africa.\n\nU.S. Assistance to Uganda\n\nThe United States is Uganda’s largest bilateral donor. U.S. assistance enhances social and economic well-being throughout the country, and U.S. support improves the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans. Development programs foster Ugandan-managed delivery of services and support national development priorities to build national and local capacity. More than 700,000 Ugandans receive life-saving antiretroviral treatment funded by U.S. assistance. In post-conflict northern Uganda, the United States has shifted its support from emergency humanitarian assistance to longer-term development programs that provide for reconciliation, basic services, and security.\n\nU.S. assistance includes promoting good governance, human rights, multiparty democracy, and free and fair elections; professionalizing police and military institutions for better service delivery and adherence to human rights; addressing health threats including malaria through the President’s Malaria Initiative, and HIV/AIDS through the Global Health Initiative, as well as improving maternal and child health and addressing Uganda’s fast population growth through family planning; supporting the Ugandan government's plans in agricultural productivity, food security, and nutrition through the President’s Feed the Future Initiative; and addressing environmental issues such as global climate change and biodiversity through the President’s Global Climate Change Initiative.\n\nSince 2011, the United States has provided a small number of military advisers to the LRA-affected region to enhance the capacity of the Ugandan and other regional militaries to pursue the LRA and protect civilian populations. The United States supports the efforts of Uganda and its regional partners to bring the LRA’s top leaders to justice, promote defections from the LRA’s ranks, and assist affected communities. Over the past several years, the United States has provided significant military, development, and humanitarian resources to support this effort. As part of our comprehensive counter-LRA strategy, the United States provides assistance that empowers LRA-affected communities, expands information networks, delivers humanitarian relief, and supports vulnerable populations.\n\nBilateral Economic Relations\n\nUganda is eligible for preferential trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. U.S. exports to Uganda include machinery, optical and medical instruments, wheat, and aircraft. U.S. imports from Uganda include coffee, cocoa, base metals, and fish and seafood. The United States has committed to signing trade and investment framework agreements with the East African Community and with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa; negotiations are underway. Uganda is a member of both regional organizations.\n\nUganda's Membership in International Organizations\n\nUganda and the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization.\n\nBilateral Representation\n\nThe current U.S. Ambassador to Uganda is Deborah Malac. Other principal embassy officials are listed in the Department's Key Officers List. Uganda maintains an embassy in the United States at 5911 16th Street NW, Washington, DC 20011 (tel. 202-726-7100).\n\nMore information about Uganda is available from the Department of State and other sources, some of which are listed here:",

The bill was introduced in parliament last December.\n\nWhat are the changes?\nThe law, if passed, will make digital platforms pay local media outlets and publishers to link their content in news feeds or search results.\n\nUnder the amendments to the proposed bill, the Australian government will take into account commercial agreements that digital platforms like Google and Facebook have already made with local news media businesses before deciding if the code applies to the tech giants.\n\nThe government will also give the digital platforms one month’s notice before reaching the final decision.\n\nIt will also include a two-month mediation period to allow digital platforms and publishers to broker deals before they are made to enter arbitration as a last resort.The arbitration clause has been one of Facebook’s main points of objection.\n\nThe bill says that if both sides are unable to reach a commercial deal, then government-appointed arbitrators can decide on the final price by ruling in favor of either party — the digital platform or the publisher — with no room for a middle-ground agreement, according to experts.\n\nTuesday’s amendments are expected to provide “further clarity” to digital platforms and news organizations on how the bargaining code will be implemented, the government said.\n\nIt would also “add further impetus for parties to engage in commercial negotiations” outside the media bargaining code, the government added.\n\nSeven West Media, which owns the Australian broadcast network Seven, said Tuesday it signed a letter of intent to provide news content to Facebook. It also signed a similar agreement with Google this month.\n\nWhat happened before this?\nBoth Google and Facebook have fought against the media law since last year.\n\nGoogle previously threatened to remove its search service from Australia in response to the proposed law. But the company has since struck commercial deals with local publishers including the Murdoch family-owned media conglomerate News Corp.\n\nFacebook, for its part, followed through with a threat to remove news features from Australia.\n\nLast week, the company said Australian users would not be able to view or share news content while international users would not be able to access Australian news content on its platform. The move faced backlash from politicians as well as users, after important government health and emergency pages on Facebook were blocked.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had been in contact with Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as both parties worked to resolve issues around the law.\n\nCampbell Brown, Facebook’s vice president for global news partnership, said Tuesday that the Australian government clarified that the company will retain the ability to decide if news appears on its platform so that it won’t automatically be subject to a forced negotiation.\n\n“We’ll continue to invest in news globally and resist efforts by media conglomerates to advance regulatory frameworks that do not take account of the true value exchange between publishers and platforms like Facebook,” Brown said.\n\n— CNBC’s Will Koulouris contributed to this report.",

Third-placed #1 car of Gustavo Menezes was in danger of being lapped after four hours, a fate that already befell the fourth-placed #3 car of Le Mans veteran Romain Dumas.\n\nThe fifth and final LMP1 entrant, the #4 ByKolles car, spent time in the garage in the third hour with an alternator problem and returned to the track eight laps down.\n\nIn LMP2, the #39 Graff Racing Oreca gained the lead in the second hour with James Allen behind the wheel, but that car disappeared from the front due to a wild spin from Vincent Capillaire in the Porsche Curves after 3h30, which prompted the Frenchman to make an extra pitstop.\n\nIn the #37 Jackie Chan DC Racing Oreca, Will Stevens made rapid progress and took over the lead of the race before handing over the car to Ho-Pin Tung. At the four-hour mark the car was running fifth, but it was the only LMP2 runner to have made seven pitstops.\n\nJob van Uitert drove the #32 United Autosports Oreca to the front before handing over to Will Owen, who assumed the lead after four hours, courtesy of earlier stops for both Tung and the #26 G-Drive of Roman Rusinov.\n\nFormula E champion Antonio Felix da Costa made good progress after his #38 JOTA Sport Oreca qualified in the pack and handed the car over to Roberto Gonzalez while running in the top three.\n\nThe #30 Duqueine Oreca is also in the hunt after stellar driving by Konstantin Tereschenko, passing the polesitter #22 United Autosports of Phil Hanson.\n\nThe #97 Aston Martin took control of GTE Pro in the third hour. Maxime Martin caught and passed the #71 AF Corse Ferrari of Miguel Molina for the lead in the first Mulsanne chicane around 2h20 into the race, before handing over the car to Ford refugee Harry Tincknell.\n\nIn the #51 AF Corse entry, Alessandro Pier Guidi also passed Molina, who then handed the car over to Sam Bird. Bird remained in third throughout the fourth hour but cycled to the lead at various times on a different pitstop cycle.\n\nMarco Sorensen handed the second #95 Aston over to Richard Westbrook, another former Ford GT driver, in fourth.\n\nLaurens Vanthoor took the reins of the #92 Porsche 911 RSR-19, which went off-sequence after a puncture for Michael Christensen. Porsche are struggling to match Aston Martin and Ferrari for outright pace, #91 driver Fred Makowiecki languishing in seventh.\n\nIn GTE Am, the #83 AF Corse Ferrari of Emmanuel Collard benefited by pitting under a Slow Zone to vault into the lead just before the four-hour mark.\n\nRoss Gunn initially led the way throughout his stint in the #98 Aston Martin. When he handed over the car to the team’s amateur driver Paul Dalla Lana, the car dropped to third as the competition was still using its pro drivers and the Canadian businessman lost time by going off in the Porsche Curves.\n\nSalih Yoluc then assumed the lead in the #90 Aston, but was caught and passed by Larry ten Voorde in the #56 Team Project 1 Porsche before a Slow Zone promoted Collard to the lead.\n\nAugusto Farfus took over the #98 Aston before the four-hour mark to reclaim lost ground.",

    "content": "As the controversial Catholic synod closed this weekend, Roman Catholic bishops voted on a summary document which decided against overhauling the church’s teaching on gay Catholics.Summarising the gathering, Pope Francis described the Vatican summit as a way to “open up broader horizons, rising above conspiracy theories and blinkered viewpoints”.\n\n“Surely it was not about finding exhaustive solutions for all the difficulties and uncertainties which challenge and threaten the family,” he said.\n\n“But rather about seeing these difficulties and uncertainties in the light of the Faith, carefully studying them and confronting them fearlessly, without burying our heads in the sand.”\n\nHowever, although his language may have seemed welcoming, the final document released by the Vatican was by no means a triumph for progressives.\n\nThe document – agreed on Saturday night – reflects the continuing deep rift that remains between conservative and progressive factions within the church hierarchy.The language describing same-sex marriage as “not even remotely analogous” to heterosexual marriage marked a clear victory for the conservative camp – who continue to argue that homosexuality is a sin.\n\nThe bishops concluded that church teaching would remain – it was agreed that homosexuals should not be discriminated against but said there were “absolutely no grounds” for gay marriage.\n\nThe Pope also alluded to the scandal and rumour that has plagued the divisive Synod, saying “the different opinions which were freely expressed – and at times, unfortunately, not in entirely well-meaning ways.”\n\nThis final ruling may not come as a surprise to many – especially given the pontiff’s opening statements to the gathering.\n\nNevertheless, it will still come as a blow to the countless LGBT Catholics who were hoping for a more inclusive outcome.\n\nIn a clear challenge to that doctrine, Monsignor Krzysztof Charamsa announced that he was a gay, practising Catholic priest a day before the gathering took place – before calling for the synod to take up the plight of gays and attacking the “paranoid” homophobia of the church.\n\nIgnoring his pleas, the Vatican subsequently fired him – claiming “the decision to make such a pointed statement” was “very serious and irresponsible”\n\nIn addition, despite an early ‘who am I to judge’ PR blitz attempting to bolster his image, the Pope is yet to lift any of the actively homophobic and transphobic policies of his predecessors.\n\nProposals to ‘reach out’ to gay people were scrapped by the Church last year – and despite suggestions that the plans would return this year, it is clear that the Church has no plans to change its stance on the subject.\n\nMore: Catholic Church, krzysztof charamsa, Pope Francis, same sex marriage, Vatican",

    "content": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are taking legal action against the publishers of a British newspaper after it published a private letter the duchess wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle.In February, the Mail on Sunday published a handwritten note shared by the elder Markle, in which his famous daughter accuses him of “turning a blind eye to the pain” he’s causing by speaking to the media. The letter is dated August 2018, three months after the royal wedding, which Thomas Markle missed after it emerged that he had posed for staged paparazzi photos.\n\nA statement posted by Prince Harry on Tuesday revealed that the royals have now “initiated legal proceedings” against the publication and its parent company Associated Newspapers, citing the misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018. Schillings, the legal firm representing the couple, called the letter’s publication “part of a campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband.”Prince Harry also defended his wife against the “bullying.”\n\n“My wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences — a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son,” he wrote.\n\nPrince Harry continued: “There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face — as so many of you can relate to — I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.”\n\nHe went on to note the positive reception the couple’s current royal tour in Africa has seen, and alluded to his mother Princess Diana’s death:\n\n“The positive coverage of the past week from these same publications exposes the double standards of this specific press pack that has vilified her almost daily for the past nine months; they have been able to create lie after lie at her expense simply because she has not been visible while on maternity leave. She is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you’ve seen on this Africa tour.”\n\n“Though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one,” he continued. “Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.”\n\nThe statement added that the couple are paying for the lawsuit privately and will donate any proceeds from damages to \"an anti-bullying charity.”\n\nIn 2016, Prince Harry issued a statement decrying the “wave of abuse and harassment” targeting his then-girlfriend Meghan. And in May, he accepted damages and an apology after a photo agency violated their privacy by taking up-close images of their home. Members of the public have also risen to the couple’s defense in response to complaints over the decision to have a private christening for son Archie and other criticism.\n\nThe legal proceedings have already riled up frequent Meghan critic Piers Morgan, who tweeted that the complaint revealed her “true colors.”",

    "content": "France, despite its reputation as a beacon of progressive liberalism, has been at the forefront of a burgeoning pan-European far-right movement.\n\nMarine Le Pen, an anti-immigration Eurosceptic who may well top the first round of France's presidential election on 23 April, is riding a populist insurgency that has been growing over the past 15 years.\n\nIts themes are familiar in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit: concern for hardworking people, support for traditional values, and opposition to immigration and supranational busybodies.\n\nBut the most distinctive characteristic of France's patriotic surge is youth. Unlike their contemporaries in the US and the UK, the under-30s in France are more nationalistic than the general population.\n\nAt the radical end of the movement are the \"identitaires\", or identitarians - the equivalent of the American alt-right.\n\nWho are the identitarians?\nTheir standard bearers are Génération Identitaire (GI), a group that specialises in publicity stunts that it films and posts online to advertise its fight to reclaim French territory said to have been lost to foreign migrants.GI has 120,000 Facebook fans - almost twice as many as the youth wings of the Socialist Party and the centre-right Republicans combined.\n\nUnlike the skinheads of old, the group sticks to non-violence. The iPhone, it has found, is mightier than the boot.Following a group of activists handing out flyers in Paris, however, it is clear that they relish verbal confrontation. Their leader Pierre Larti, 26, stands surrounded by a group of North African men.\n\n\"When I read this leaflet I understand that you don't want me here,\" one says.\n\n\"What we don't want is the replacement of our values by Islamic ones,\" replies Mr Larti. \"France is historically a Christian country. I'm not criticising anyone. What happens in your land is your business. What happens here is ours. We are against colonisation, and this is why we don't want the same phenomenon to happen in reverse.\"Oddly, perhaps, for a group passionately attached to national differences, GI is sprouting branches across Europe. But identitarians see the whole continent as a battleground between European and Islamic culture.\n\nJean-Yves Le Gallou, a former Euro-MP, speaks of a struggle for \"civilisational\" identity. \"Whether you are Dutch, German or French,\" he says, \"you have the same problem and have the same view of the world.\"\n\nMr Le Gallou, 69, has produced a video entitled Being European (\"Europe is not a globalised, borderless space. Europe is not African or Muslim territory.\") that has been viewed more than 3.2m times on YouTube in less than two years - three times as many as Being French, a sister video extolling his homeland.\n\nMr Le Gallou's website, Polemia, stands at the high-brow end of France's identitarian spectrum. In the 1970s, he was a leading member of the Nouvelle Droite, an influential group of far-right thinkers.\n\nHis continued influence is testament to the deep intellectual roots of the identitarian movement.\n\nIt also highlights the power of new media. Without the internet, Mr Le Gallou and others would have no mass audience. Their warnings against the \"Great Replacement\" of locals by immigrants are no-go areas for mainstream journalists.\n\nSpreading the message online\nShut out by traditional media, identitarians have thrived on the web over the past decade. One of the online stars is Fdesouche, a news aggregator that features links to articles and clips from mainstream sites selected to chronicle chaos in migrant suburbs.\n\nFdesouche offers no comment, but leaves readers to draw their own conclusions: Islamists and \"racaille\" (\"rabble\" - code for dark-skinned criminals) are threatening to take over the country, one housing estate at a time.\n\nFdesouche gets about 3m views per month, dwarfing the websites of mainstream politicians. Emmanuel Macron, a centrist with a devoted following of hipsters, manages less than 1m.Fdesouche's success has spawned a swarm of imitators and rivals.\n\nIs France's online far right a threat to democracy?\n\nOften collectively called the \"fachosphère\" (from \"fascist\"), websites denouncing mass immigration and Islam have seen spectacular growth in France over the past 10 years. And France's cyber-patriots are a diverse lot.One fault line divides new-model identitarians, who view Muslims as the main threat, from traditionalists who believe the chief malevolent force in the world is \"Zionism\".\n\nThe most prominent anti-Zionist is Alain Soral. His website, Égalité et Reconciliation (E&R), weaves nationalist and left-wing themes by calling for solidarity with people from poor countries.\n\nSoral rejects accusations of \"anti-Semitism\". He sees a clear distinction between \"ordinary Jews\" and what he calls the organised Jewish lobby, which he says is persecuting him.\n\nHe sympathises with native French people, but feels identitarians are focusing on the wrong target. By \"inciting poor whites to turn against blacks and Muslims\" they were doing the work of Zionists, he told the BBC.Alain Soral is regularly prosecuted for incitement. But he is no bit-part player. E&R has more readers than Fdesouche, and by some measures is France's most popular political website.\n\nVarious parts of the online alt-right may be firing from different directions, but their target is the same: the political and media establishment.\n\nSuch resentment is not the preserve of the identitarian fringe, or of people languishing in neglected provinces.\n\nOpposition to liberal elites and concern about the disappearance of borders are widespread, and increasingly being aired in the heart of Paris.\n\nAt Sciences Po, an institution that trains the next generation of government and business leaders. Eurosceptic students have set up a club, \"Critique of European Reason\" (CRE), to wage the fight where it matters.\n\nIts leader, Nicolas Pouvreau, says the group has managed to \"create a Eurosceptic safe space in an environment that remains hostile.\"\n\nAnother member, Sarah Knafo, says the rising popularity of Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) - France's largest party - has earned the group a grudging respect on campus: \"We represent something bigger than us, and people dare not despise us as much as they used to.\"\n\nLast year's Brexit vote in the UK thrilled CRE members. The next morning they gathered outside the UK embassy to drink champagne and sing God Save the Queen.\n\nAnti-white racism\nBeyond hostility to the EU, CRE members regard uncontrolled migration and trade flows as a source of social disintegration.\n\nIt would be wrong to label Critique of European Reason as far-right. The group brings together one-nation activists from both the left and the right who have much more in common with one another than with the moderates in their respective camps.Kevin, another CRE student who supports hard-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is as hostile to multiculturalism as the conservatives within the group.\n\nHaving lived in an immigrant banlieue (suburb) he says he has often been called \"dirty white\", and says the mainstream press denies the reality of \"anti-white racism\".\n\nUnfashionable as they are, these feelings are widespread among those who have left the banlieues.\n\n\"I have suffered from being white,\" says Ugo Iannuzzi, a Sorbonne student.\n\n\"I have often cried. I used to go to school with fear in my stomach. You start to feel bad about being white, about being French and loving your origins because you get beaten up, your phone gets stolen and glasses smashed.\"\n\nMr Iannuzzi supports the FN. But his resentment of the political and media elites mirrors that of left-wingers like Mr Vercin.\n\nLost generation\nAlexandre Devecchio, a journalist and author of a book on various tribes of young French rebels, calls all those preoccupied with the erosion of identity the \"Zemmour generation\". Eric Zemmour is an influential writer-broadcaster who argues that the 1968 revolt has led France to ruin.\n\nMany of today's twentysomethings, Mr Devecchio argues, agree with Zemmour because they feel let down. Born after the fall of the Berlin Wall, they were expected to blossom in an open, rainbow society within a pacified, post-historical Europe.\n\n\"For that generation, reality did not follow the script,\" Mr Devecchio told the BBC. What they have experienced is unemployment, insecure jobs, and a sense of physical and cultural insecurity in areas where radical Islam is on the rise, he believes.\n\nCould the identitarians and the wider Zemmour generation help Marine Le Pen win power?\n\nAt the moment that appears unlikely. Ms Le Pen lacks the backing of a major party, and is expected to be defeated by any second-round opponent.\n\nBut she can draw comfort from the fact that polls have underestimated the support of other populist leaders.\n\nHigh abstention levels could also help her. The instinct to rally around whoever runs against the FN is much weaker now than in the past. Polls suggest that half the voters backing hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon would either abstain or back Ms Le Pen in a second round against Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAnd should she lose the race, the setback could be temporary if her victorious opponent fails to bring about reform.\n\nIdentitarianism feeds on pessimism. The country's patriotic rebels are young and may have time on their side.",

    "content": "Last week, the Obama administration announced a major step forward in medical marijuana research regulations — or, so it seemed.\n\nWhile the Drug Enforcement Agency neglected to deschedule marijuana as a Schedule I drug, a move many in the medical and political community were hoping for, the agency did promise to improve access to researchers studying the plant. At first, scientists applauded the move, excited to finally expedite sorely-needed studies. But then they heard the details.\n\n“DEA has concluded the best way to satisfy the current researcher demand for a variety of strains of marijuana…is to increase the number of federally authorized marijuana growers,” the agency wrote in its August 12 statement.\n\nTo researchers, this is actually the least important roadblock facing them. Ryan Vandrey, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University, has been studying cannabis for years, but he’s never needed much marijuana to accurately study the drug.\nIn his current collaborative study of marijuana’s affects on PTSD symptoms, Vandrey said he only needs 20 grams of the drug to conduct experiments.“[Adding growers] will make very little change going forward in my research,” he said. “The problem is not a lack of supply, it’s the regulatory hoops we have to jump through to obtain it.”\n\nOf course, jumping through hoops is standard in any scientific research process. But Vandrey said this process is unnecessarily laborious for cannabis studies.\n\nFirst, researchers go through the regular steps to approve any drug research: Secure grant funding, obtain a scientific review of the study’s merits, and get approval from an ethics board and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nBut to study marijuana, which is still categorized as a narcotic with no accepted medical use by the DEA, a researcher must obtain a Schedule I license both from the federal government and from the state where the study is located. To do so, a lab must met stringent requirements like having a safe to store the drug that is bolted to the ground — something Vandrey said few facilities, aside from major research hospitals like his, can afford.The Schedule I license approval process can take up to a year. Then, the DEA analyzes the study itself, along with the “scientific merits” of the researcher.\n\n“My last study took a year and a half to be approved,” Vandrey said. “And now I’m waiting again.”\n\nAny small change in the study requires another lengthy reevaluation from the DEA, a process that has forced Vandrey to put his current project on hold. And the feds don’t make this process easy, either.“Not only do we have to jump through regulatory hoops to do our science, but there’s also no time limit on the DEA to review our work,” Vandrey said. “I’ve been on the phone with the DEA every day, checking on the status. They’d never call us.”\n\nLast week’s announcement was far from a solution, Vandrey said. Real change, he added, would come in the form of descheduling the drug and creating an entirely separate entity to control it, like how alcohol is currently regulated in the United States. Or, if that’s too big of a jump, the government could simply rewrite the rules around marijuana research — even while it remains a Schedule I drug — to simplify researchers’ access.\n\nTo Vandrey, this isn’t about the quickest path to legalization. In fact, he’s actually concerned that so many states have already legalized a drug that has been so poorly studied.\n\n“We have a crazy problem. States have legalized this drug without the existence of adequate data on its safety as a form of medical treatment,” he said. “We have an inordinate amount of anecdotal reports. I am sympathetic to the people who have found it to help cure medical symptoms, but we are going about this in a unsafe matter.”Which is, ironically, why the DEA refused to deschedule marijuana in the first place. “There are no adequate safety studies; there are no adequate and well-controlled studies proving efficacy; the drug is not accepted by qualified experts; and the scientific evidence is not widely available,” wrote DEA head Chuck Rosenberg in last week’s release. But he did not explain how these studies could exist with such stringent regulations keeping researchers waiting months for a green light.\n\nThere is no other type of scientific research that requires a sign-off by a non-scientific agency like the DEA.\n\nHowever, researchers aren’t fighting alone. Despite last week’s decision, lawmakers continue to push for access to medical marijuana research with active legislation. One of these bills, introduced by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) in June, would streamline the research approval process by placing time limits on agencies’ review time",

    "content": "Since Macedonia declared a state of emergency in its border areas at the end of August, the \"Balkan Route\" has become notorious.\n\nUp to 3,000 refugees, mainly from countries in the Middle East, arrive in the small south-east European country each day. A similar number cross borders into Serbia and Hungary - most of them ultimately hoping to reach Germany.\n\nAll this has served to overshadow another significant exodus - not through the Balkans, but actually from the countries of the region. In the first seven months of 2015, Germany received almost 200,000 requests for asylum. More than four in 10 of those applicants came from the Western Balkans.\n\nAlmost 30,000 of those people came from Albania - and a similar number from neighbouring Kosovo. Syria is the only country with more applicants. This represents a massive rise: Germany only received 8,000 asylum applications from citizens of Albania during the whole of 2014.\n\nIn the 1990s, conflict and forced displacement were behind the arrival in Germany of tens of thousands of ethnic-Albanian Kosovars. But no such emergency can explain this year's mass movement.\n\nSimilarly, Albania has travelled a long way from the communist dictatorship of Enver Hoxha. It is now a democratic country and EU membership candidate led by the artist-turned-prime minister, Edi Rama.\n\nBut Kosovo and Albania share several common factors: small populations (around two million and three million, respectively); an ethnic-Albanian majority and little in the way of economic prospects.This last factor has been the motivation behind many of the departures for Germany.\n\nThe Pristina branch of a German NGO, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, conducted a limited survey during January and February. It found that almost all of those leaving Kosovo's capital were driven by the dire economic situation - and were hoping to find jobs in Germany.\n\nAround the same time, the BBC spoke to young people in the town of Mitrovica. One said young Kosovars were \"like birds in a cage\". Legitimate travel to EU countries was difficult because of visa restrictions. But at home, there were few prospects: the youth unemployment rate is around 60%.\n\nSimilar causes are behind the exodus from Albania, complicated by the return of tens of thousands of people who had lost jobs in Greece and Italy due to the financial crisis. To them, Albania's average monthly wage of €350 (£255) must seem unacceptably low.\n\nUntil now neither Kosovo nor Albania have been on Germany's list of \"safe countries of origin\", although that is set to change. So even though most asylum applications are doomed to failure, it takes almost a year before many people are ordered to leave the country.But what of the asylum applications from Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro? There were almost 20,000 of these in the year to the end of July - and the great majority of these were Roma people, more than 90% in the case of Serbia.\n\nAccording to organisations that work with Roma people this shows that despite the Decade of Roma Inclusion, an initiative that is backed by many eastern European states and comes to an end on 10 September, many people have been left in vulnerable situations.\n\n\"We had this Roma decade, lots of donors putting money in - but some of the key indicators have deteriorated compared to 10 years ago,\" says Dritan Nelaj of the Open Society Foundation.\"Roma people rely on informal income while economies are being regulated and formalised - they lose their position in the market and their income disappears. Housing and employment are not there. On the other hand, people feel discriminated against.\"\n\nSo for many Roma people, heading for Germany seems an attractive option. They trade insecure housing in the Western Balkans for a relatively well-appointed asylum centre - and even receive an allowance of €140 per month while their claims are assessed.\n\n\"Usually refugees want swift asylum procedures,\" says Milita Sunjic of the Belgrade branch of the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR.\n\n\"But in this case, they complain they're too short. Roma people tell me they know they're not going to get asylum - but at least they're safe and warm.\"\n\nUnlike the unusual exodus from Kosovo and Albania, the plight of the region's Roma people is a perennial problem.\n\nMr Nelaj suggests the discrimination they face should make them legitimate candidates for asylum.\n\nAnd Milita Sunjic says that as long as Roma families continue to suffer \"abject poverty\", they will continue to try their luck in Germany.",

    "content": "TORONTO (Reuters) - A key supplier of the chemicals needed to test for coronavirus, France's Biomérieux BIOX.PA, has given its proprietary formula to the Canadian government for free so its national lab can try to manufacture badly-needed test kits on its own, according to federal officials and a note to customers obtained by Reuters.The unusual deal shows Ottawa’s determination to scale up testing, a key step towards relaxing strict public health measures that have disrupted daily life and tanked economies around the world.\n\nIn March, Canada passed emergency legislation that gave the government and third parties it designates the right to produce patented goods without the patent holders’ consent. Doing that could have been technically difficult, without a company’s formula.\n\nWhile there is no indication that Canada forced Biomerieux to agree to the license, the option was available.\n\nBiomérieux did not respond to questions about whether it had made similar arrangements with any other governments, or the revenue impact of the agreement.\n\nIt reported a 21.5% increase in sales in the first quarter, thanks in part to demand for reagent.The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) described the arrangement as a temporary license that allows the government to manufacture Biomérieux products used for coronavirus testing. It did not say whether it threatened to use the new law, and said the license was signed “at no cost.”\n\nPHAC said its manufacturing was still in “development and testing” and its goal was to alleviate shortages soon.\n\nIn its email to customers in early April, Biomérieux’s Canadian unit said the move was meant to clear up testing backlogs, an indication of the stress in the supply chain that makes testing possible. The company said it was also boosting its own production.\n\nThe chemicals in short supply, also called reagents, are used to extract RNA, the virus’s genetic material, from patient samples. A handful of companies make most RNA extraction equipment and sell reagent kits made for their own machines, a bit like inkjet printer cartridges.\n\nOther major suppliers are Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.N acquisition target Qiagen and Roche ROG.S. All are facing soaring demand, as public health workers around the world race to find people who could be spreading the virus.“We hope that in the near future, this move will allow federal and provincial labs to test more Canadians, thus reducing testing backlogs,” Biomerieux said in its customer note.\n\n“This private-public collaboration signals that unprecedented times, require unprecedented solutions.” Biomérieux extraction equipment is widely used in Canada.\n\nIts machines were the primary system used by Ontario’s public health labs, and heavy reliance on one brand contributed to a testing slowdown in late March. Biomérieux equipment is also widely used in Quebec, according to the provincial government.\n\nPHAC said the deal is an “interim solution”, because its facilities are not meant to be used for long-term manufacturing.\n\nOn Thursday, Canada pledged C$1.1 billion ($782 million) for research and drug or vaccine manufacturing in its fight against the coronavirus.",

The rate is higher in the Philippines, where police arrested more than 20,000 lockdown violators, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said to “shoot them dead” if needed.\n\nMalaysia said its lockdown is decreasing the spread of COVID-19. It has reported 3,116 total cases and 50 deaths as of Friday.\n\nGoogle published data showing how much mobility has changed in each nation amid lockdown, using cell phone data. Malaysia saw the presence of citizens at retail and recreation sites decrease by 81% on Sunday, compared with about a month earlier, according to Google.\n\nThe law enforcement actions have included a crackdown on speech, however, that activists worry could threaten human rights, as the former ruling party that ran Malaysia for all except two years of its modern history returns to power.\n\nIn addition to lockdown violators, the authorities have arrested people for allegedly spreading misinformation online about the virus. Journalists say they are self-censoring news about the virus to avoid punishment from the government.\n\n“Human rights workers, free expression advocates, bloggers, software developers, and activists are all in danger when government uses leeway obtained during a crisis to curtail free expression far beyond what’s required,” said Jason Kelley, a digital strategist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for an open internet.\n\nHe noted in a blog post that Malaysia is among several governments arresting people for alleged misinformation, and he says many of those arrested are activists.\n\nEconomists say the political turmoil in Kuala Lumpur will make it hard for the government to fight the coronavirus. Mahathir Mohamad, who became prime minister again in 2018 thanks mostly to the 1MDB corruption scandal that sank the prior regime, tried to consolidate power in February. His failure caused a political crisis until the old ruling party stepped into the power vacuum in March.\n\nWith the old party back in power, the government has started to stabilize, but the virus is still threatening the economy. Malaysia is one of the first three economies in the region, in addition to Singapore and Thailand, to predict a recession this year because of the coronavirus.\n\nIn response, the government announced last week the “People's Economic Stimulus Package,” locally abbreviated as PRIHATIN, to deal with COVID-19. The package includes $57.3 billion worth of cash aid, loans, deferred taxes and debt payments, along with other aid.\n\n“The sheer size of PRIHATIN signals the seriousness and sincerity in the government's approach,” said Jason Liang and Krystal Ng, partners at law firm Wong & Partners, in a joint assessment. “These measures ought to be far-reaching and should provide a source of encouragement and relief.”",

The country, which has a population of 10 million, has recorded 609,000 cases and 9,920 deaths as of Jan. 22, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. \nThis is the second time that the bishops have suspended public worship. The first was in March 2020, when the pandemic arrived in the country located on the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain. The restrictions were eased at the end of May.\n\nThe bishops said that public Masses would be suspended from Jan. 23 -- the day before the country's presidential election -- along with catechesis and other pastoral activities that required people to gather. They called on priests to offer livestreamed Masses. \n\nThe bishops had called for the suspension or postponement of baptisms, confirmations, and marriages earlier this month.\n\nThey said that funerals could be celebrated according to norms issued in May last year, which require mourners to maintain a social distance.\n\nA Lenten retreat for the bishops, scheduled for Feb. 22-26, has also been canceled.\n\nThe Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which has been hit hard financially by the pandemic, will broadcast three Masses and two rosary prayers daily while public Masses are suspended. \n\n\n\nThe Masses, which will be transmitted via the shrine's website, will take place at 11 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. local time. The rosary will be recited at 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. local time.\n\nShrine rector Fr. Carlos Cabecinhas said: \"We know that it is not the same to be physically present or to be able to follow on television, but that is the one possible way we have to participate now and therefore we want to be present with you through this difficult moment.\"",

This occurred on Thursday December 19, 2019.\n\nOur international gift to all—students, STEM education, the public and the amateur radio community—was the historic transfer of the first Interoperable Radio System (IORS) flight unit, serial number 1001, to NASA Johnson Space Center for launch on SpaceX CRS-20.  The special gift received by ARISS was the approval from NASA Safety to launch the IORS on SpaceX CRS-20 and stow the radio system on the International Space Station.  December 19, 2019 was truly a banner day for ARISS!\n\nThe IORS is a foundational element of the ARISS next generation radio system and is an incredible engineering achievement by the ARISS hardware team. This first element delivery will support easier radio mode transitions and enable new, exciting capabilities for hams, students and the general public.  The IORS will include a higher power radio, an enhanced voice repeater, updated digital packet radio (APRS) capabilities and slow scan television (SSTV) capabilities for both the US and Russian segments. The IORS consists of a special, modified JVCKenwood TM-D710GA transceiver, an AMSAT-developed multi voltage power supply and interconnecting cables.\n\nThis first flight IORS will be installed in the ISS Columbus module.  A second flight unit is expected to be launched sometime in 2020 for installation in the Russian Service module.  A total of 4 flight units and 10 total units will be built by the ARISS hardware team to support on-board flight operations, training, operations planning and hardware testing.  Future upgrades and enhancements to the next generation system are in various stages of design & development.  These include a repaired Ham Video system (currently planned for launch in mid-to-late 2020), L-band (uplink) repeater, ground command operations capability, LimeSDR signal reception, a microwave “Ham Communicator” and Lunar Gateway prototype experiment.\n\nWhile yesterday was truly an historic milestone, it should be noted that there is still much “heavy lifting” work to be done to prepare the IORS for Operations on ISS.  ARISS has 92 engineering requirements and our operations Phase III safety review to complete.  The space agencies take a position of “Trust but Verify.”  Thus, these engineering and safety “verifications” all need to be closed out before the IORS can be unstowed and turned on.  This will be the ARISS hardware team’s focus over the next few months.\n\nAlso, please remember that ARISS is almost entirely run by volunteers.  So donations to the ARISS program for next generation hardware developments, operations, education and administrative functions are always welcome.\n\nIn closing, ARISS would like to thank the outstanding contributions of the IORS hardware development team on an incredible radio system.  ARISS would like to thank our sponsors and donors for helping us realize the IORS hardware systems.  On behalf of the ARISS team, we would like to wish you all a joyful and prosperous Holiday Season—Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Happy New Year!!",

In addition to sex between same-sex partners being legal, Taiwan has also banned anti-LGBT discrimination in workplaces and schools and permitted individuals to change their genders. Now, it seems the next step forward for the state could come in the form of marriage equality.\n\nMarriage equality was first proposed by the executive branch of the Taiwan government (Executive Yuan) in 2003 but was stalled in the face of massive opposition from cabinet members and conservative lawmakers. Members of the government’s legislative branch, led by legislator Yu Mei-Nu, attempted to revive the proposal in 2012, but received considerable push-back at the committee level.\n\nNow, however, with the more liberal Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in power, members of Taiwan’s LGBT community are hopeful that marriage equality might finally be made legal.The DPP came to majority power this past May when Tsai Ing-wen (pictured below) was sworn in as Taiwan’s first female president.\n\nThe liberal politician has long been an advocate for LGBT rights and marriage equality; last year, she voiced her support for the community in a Pride video on her Facebook page in which she said, “I support marriage equality. Every person should be able to look for love freely, and freely seek their own happiness.”Following Tsai’s inauguration, Yu stated that she was planning to reintroduce marriage equality to the legislative branch later this year. Though she now has cross-party support, she predicts that the legislation will not pass until the end of Tsai’s term in 2020.\n\nJason Hsu, a member of DPP’s rival party Kuomintang, agrees that LGBT equality is a top priority and will only come about through cross-party collaboration. In an interview with CNN, Hsu commented, “This is an issue that shouldn’t be ideological. It’s a sign of a society’s progressiveness.”\nIn addition to the right to marry, the legislation would allow same-sex couples to inherit wealth and property as well as access surrogacy parent arrangements. If Taiwan were to vote the legislation into law, it would become the first state in Asia to have full marriage equality.",

His last residence was his family's home in Eden Prairie.\n\nJaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that early in the case Idd's family asked the governor's office to refer its review to the attorney general. \"He has failed to step in,\" Hussein said of Walz.\n\nThe governor's office declined to address the criticism or its role in such matters.\n\n\"The attorney general has not asked our office for this case,\" said Walz's spokeswoman Claire Lancaster.\n\nJohn Stiles, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, said the office has not been involved in the case. He declined to say whether it would ask to review the case. In conjunction with the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, the attorney general successfully prosecuted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin this year in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nIdd's killing was the first by Minneapolis police after Floyd's death on May 25, 2020.\n\nKeena issued a 13-page memo supporting her decision, noting that the three officers provided consistent statements about Idd disobeying orders, attempting to flee in his vehicle and firing a gun at them first.\n\n\"Although I have concluded the use of deadly force was justified in this instance, any loss of life is a tragic occurrence and I wish to extend my personal condolences to the family of Dolal Idd for their great loss,\" Keena said in a written statement.\n\nMinnesota law allows officers to use deadly force to protect officers or the public from death or great bodily harm, among other circumstances.\n\nThe Dakota County Attorney's Office reviewed the matter under an agreement among Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington county attorneys to ask an outside agency to review and prosecute such cases.A search warrant affidavit filed in the case earlier this year said officers were investigating \"a person selling firearms illegally and prohibited from possessing firearms\" and used a confidential informant to set up the purchase of a MAC-10 semi-automatic pistol from Idd.\n\nAccording to Keena's memo: Schmitt was parked in the gas station lot in an unmarked squad while seven other officers in two marked squad cars and one unmarked squad parked near an alley waiting for Idd.\n\nIdd arrived about 6:13 p.m. with a female passenger and parked. Huynh entered the lot in a marked squad with the lights and siren activated and parked so that the squad's front bumper touched Idd's back bumper. Huynh and another officer exited the squad.\n\nAt the same time, Klund entered the lot from a different entrance with the lights on his unmarked squad activated. He parked near the rear passenger side of Idd's vehicle \"in an attempt to box it in,\" the memo said. An officer who was with Klund exited the vehicle.\n\nIdd tried to drive around the squads. Huynh approached Idd's vehicle with his gun pointed at the car. He ordered Idd to stop as Schmitt approached on foot with his gun pointed at Idd's vehicle.Schmitt yelled, \"Hands up!\" Idd ignored the officers' orders and tried to flee, Keena wrote.\n\nAnother officer parked his marked squad near Huynh's squad to form a \"V\" to block Idd. Klund drove his squad into the driver's side of Idd's vehicle and pinned it against a truck that was parked in the lot.\n\n\"Within moments after being pinned in, Mr. Idd discharged a firearm through the driver's side window … striking the hood of the unmarked squad car driven by Sergeant Klund,\" Keena wrote.\n\nHuynh, Klund and Schmitt fired back, the memo said. Idd died at the scene.\n\nIdd's passenger, who was not hurt, told investigators that once police blocked him in, Idd said he didn't want to go to jail and fired a gun through his window, Keena's memo said.\n\nMinneapolis police released body camera footage a day after Idd's death that appeared to show Idd firing a gun at police first. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo defended his officers.\n\nActivists said Friday that the 27-second clip was insufficient and that the family and public should have access to all video footage.\n\n\"That is not accountability,\" activist Toussaint Morrison said of the video clip.\n\nIdd was 3 when his family emigrated from Somalia. He graduated from Minnetonka High School in 2015 and briefly enrolled at Normandale Community College in Bloomington.\n\nKlund, who has since retired, was a 33-year veteran of the department; Huynh was a 23-year veteran and Schmitt a six-year veteran.",

The action is being taken as part of the University's overall redesign to emerge from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a way that financially stabilizes the institution.\n \nAffected by the decision are the sports of men's cross country, men's golf and women's tennis. With the change, UA, which previously sponsored 20 sports, will now have 17 sports (7 men's sports and 10 women's sports). Akron will remain a member of The Mid-American Conference (MAC).\n \nThe move affects 23 male and 9 female student-athletes. The elimination of these sports, along with salary reductions for select coaches, staff position eliminations, scholarship and operating expenditure reductions will total approximately $4.4 million.\n \n\"These decisions are very difficult but they are important and necessary at this time,\" said Director of Athletics Larry Williams. \"This action aligns us with our Mid-American Conference peers in the total number of sports and is part of the ongoing effort to redesign the University to ensure that UA continues to invest in high-demand, high-quality academic programs.\"\n \nWilliams continued, \"This morning, I met via video conference with the student-athletes affected by the decision. We understand that some may choose to leave Akron to continue in their sport at another university, and we have committed to offering them our full support throughout that process. This is a difficult day for all of us. We have dedicated student-athletes, coaches and athletics staff who have embraced being a Zip and make tremendous contributions to campus life in class, in competition and in our greater community.\"\n \nWilliams said the announcement was made today to allow the student-athletes as much time as possible to find new schools at which they can continue in their sports, if they choose to do so. This also will allow the three coaches and one graduate assistant who are impacted time to find new positions.\n \nIn reaching this decision, the University considered many factors, including: program cost, athletics facilities, University and community impacts, and likelihood of noteworthy success at the current and future funding levels.\n \nFurther details regarding the decision can be found in the FAQ document posted on the University website.",

    "content": "Over 700 Belarusians have been given refuge in Poland amid the unrest and repression that has followed August’s presidential election, at which Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory amid widespread evidence of vote rigging.\n\nPoland has during that time given strong backing to the Belarusian democratic opposition, whose exiled leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya today made a second visit to Warsaw to discuss further forms of support.Between 18 August and 18 October, 707 Belarusians have come to Poland under various forms of protection, deputy interior minister Bartosz Grodecki told the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nOf these, 399 have received humanitarian visas, which are free and allow for an initial one-year stay. Belarusians have been granted these visas through a simplified and expedited procedure.\n\nAnother 170 have been confirmed as applicants for international protection in Poland, while a further 74 declared that they have made the application. By comparison, between 2017 and 2019 the average number of applicants from Belarus was only around 40 per year, reports Euractiv.\n\nA further 119 have come with visas for entrepreneurs granted as part of the “Poland. Business Harbour” programme organised by the development ministry and Polish Investment and Trade Agency (PAiH), which aims to help individuals and firms in the ICT sector relocate to Poland.Finally, 64 Belarusians have been allowed to enter Poland on a case-by-case basis decided by the headquarters of the Border Guard, which is able to make special allowances for people who reach Poland’s borders without the paperwork needed to enter.\n\nOverall, there are currently some 28,200 Belarusians with valid residence permits in Poland, according to Euractiv. Of these, 19,100 have permanent permits due to Polish origin or documents, while 8,300 have only temporary residence.\n\nThe true numbers are likely to be much higher, however. A study published in June by Statistics Poland (GUS), a government agency, estimated that, at the end of 2019, there were over 100,000 Belarusians in Poland, making them the country’s second largest immigrant group.Meanwhile, Tsikhanouskaya, who stood in August’s presidential election against Lukashenko, today made her second visit to Poland since going into exile as the figurehead of the Belarusian opposition.\n\nShe once again met with the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, as well as with Krzysztof Szczerski, chief of staff to President Andrzej Duda, to discuss the situation in Belarus and Poland’s “future support” for the country.\n\nThe Polish government has called for the EU to create a “Marshall Plan” for Belarus that would provide economic aid if the country pursues a democratic transition. During Tsikhanouskaya’s previous visit, Morawiecki handed her the keys to a building in Warsaw that can serve as a headquarters for the Belarusian opposition.\n\nWhen the two met again today, Tsikhanouskaya appealed to the Polish prime minister for a change in the law that would allow Belarusians in Poland under humanitarian protection to work.\n\n“We do not want to live here at the expense of others,” she said, quoted by Interia. “We are grateful for the support of the Polish government, but people want to be able to earn a living and benefit the state that has accepted them.”During her visit, Tsikhanouskaya also met with Rafał Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw and a leading Polish opposition figure. The pair discussed “the possibility of Polish mayors transferring the experience of local self-government to Belarusian emergent communities”. \n\nThe Belarusian opposition leader also spoke at the College of Europe in Natolin, Warsaw, as well as at the opening of a Polish government-sponsored scholarship programme to help Belarusians expelled from universities to study at the University of Warsaw.\n\nThe scholarships are part of a “Solidarity with Belarus” plan launched by Poland in August. It allocated 50 million zloty (€11 million) towards expanding victim support programmes, providing easier access to Poland’s jobs market, and helping independent media and NGOs.Poland’s support for the Belarusian opposition has drawn anger from Lukashenko and his allies in the Kremlin. In late August, the Belarusian president accused Warsaw of wanting to grab former Polish territories from his country.\n\nSoon after, Russia’s foreign ministry condemned Poland’s “attempts to interfere in the internal affairs” of Belarus. It “urged Warsaw to return to the universally accepted norms of international law and renounce its policy of undermining the sovereignty of its neighbour”.\n\nMain image credit: Jakub Wlodek / Agencja Gazeta",

The number of severely food insecure people in Southern Africa rose to an estimated 9.6 million at the start of the lean season (October 2018 to April 2019), due to an increase of 1.1 million people in Malawi. Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique.\n\n2. There is at least an 80 per cent chance of an El Niño phenomenon between October and December 2018, coinciding with the lean season in southern Africa. An El Niño during this time is generally associated with below-average rain in parts of Southern Africa - especially southern Madagascar and the border areas of north-east South Africa, southern Mozambique and south-east Zimbabwe - and could therefore exacerbate the impacts of the erratic rainfall received to date in 2018. Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe have been identified as the six highest-risk countries and humanitarian partners activated the phase 2 of the Global Inter-Agency Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Early Action to El Niño/La Niña episodes. In addition, there is an increased chance of an African armyworm outbreak - a pest that devastates cereals and grasses - in the 2018/19 rainy season due to El Niño. Early action is therefore critical to address immediate needs and protect livelihoods ahead of a potentially poor cropping season.\n\n3. Rising levels of food insecurity are increasing protection risks, particularly for women and children. Global evidence demonstrates that food insecurity exacerbates the risk of violence, abuse, exploitation, neglect and family separation. During drought, there is an increased likelihood of child marriage and exposure to gender-based violence. The erratic rains this year are already affecting vulnerable families – including in Madagascar and Zimbabwe - who are traveling long distances in search of alternative livelihoods. This exposes women, in particular, to a heightened risk of gender-based violence. The risk of exposure to domestic violence and intimate partner violence are also expected to increase as a consequence of heightened family tensions caused by crop damages and income losses. The link between gender-based violence, sexual violence and HIV is well established, especially in countries with high HIV burdens, such as Zimbabwe. In addition, food insecurity can cause people to stop taking Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), as one of the side effects of the drugs is increased feelings of hunger.\n\n4. The number of cholera cases in Southern Africa doubled from the end of August, with over 21,000 cases reported by the end of October, mainly due to a new outbreak in Zimbabwe and an increase in cases in Tanzania. In Zimbabwe, the outbreak declared on 6 September 2018, has been brought under control and the Oral Cholera Vaccination campaign has reached 92 per cent of the nearly 1.5 million people targeted in Harare and neighbouring areas. In Tanzania, nearly 700 new cases were recorded, while in Malawi, a new outbreak was reported in Salima district. In Mozambique, new outbreaks were confirmed in Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces, with 650 and 1,650 cases respectively reported by the end of October.\n\n5. Other communicable diseases - including plague, measles and Hepatitis E – continue to impact countries in the region, while the risk of Ebola spreading beyond the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains very high. In Madagascar, 103 suspected plague cases (bubonic and pulmonary) were reported in September and October, including 38 confirmed cases and seven deaths. A measles outbreak was also confirmed in Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, on 3 October, with more than 1,900 suspected cases reported as of 3 November. The outbreak is attributed to low population immunity, and only 58 per cent of people have been vaccinated against measles in Madagascar. Separately, in Mauritius, more than 1,100 measles cases were recorded between March and October 2018. Meanwhile, Namibia continues to battle a Hepatitis E outbreak which has affected seven out of 14 districts across the country. Angola, Tanzania and Zambia are undertaking preparedness activities to prevent the spread of the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). These countries are classified as priority 2 for preparedness, as they neighbour DRC but are considerable distances from the epicentre of the outbreak.\n\n6. Civilians have been impacted by violence in both Comoros and Mozambique, while an estimated 350,000 Congolese nationals have been returned to DRC from Angola. In Comoros, localized clashes on the island of Anjouan in October resulted in people temporarily losing access to water and power, and a small number of people were briefly displaced. In Mozambique, the population of Cabo Delgado have experienced attacks by armed groups resulting in lootings and burned houses. In September, 55 homes were allegedly burned during an attack, which reportedly killed and injured several people. Meanwhile, an estimated 350,000 Congolese nationals – including 80,000 children - have been returned from Angola to DRC since the Government of Angola’s “Operação Transparência” started on 25 September. Reports indicate that returnees have experienced violence on both sides of the border, including sexual violence.\n\n7. Governments and humanitarian partners are mobilizing targeted and time-bound assistance to save lives and livelihoods during the Southern Africa lean season. However, comprehensive action by governments and development partners is urgently needed to address the root causes of chronic vulnerability in the region, in particular through investments in shock-responsive social protection systems. Regional humanitarian partners are supporting governments to enhance their preparedness for disasters and assisting the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) to develop a Regional Resilience Strategy. In addition, broader macro-economic and policy measures are required to reduce chronic needs and respond to crises in the future. These include building fiscal buffers, building resilient production systems and markets, and building on existing social safety net programmes, as highlighted following the 2016-2017 El Niño-induced drought. Without urgent and comprehensive action to this end, chronic needs across the region will continue to become acute when vulnerable communities are hit with even the smallest shock.\n\n*For further information on the food insecurity and nutrition situation, see the latest Food and Nutrition Security Working Group Update.\n\n**For the purposes of these Key Messages, the Southern Africa region includes: Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",

    "content": "1. The ministry of Catechist in the Church is an ancient one. Theologians commonly hold that the first examples are already present in the writings of the New Testament. The service of catechesis may be traced back to those “teachers” mentioned by the Apostle in writing to the community of Corinth: “Some people God has designated in the Church to be, first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then, mighty deeds; then, gifts of healing, assistance, administration, and varieties of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work mighty deeds? Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts. But I shall show you a still more excellent way” (1 Cor 12:28-31).\n\nSaint Luke begins his Gospel by stating: “I too have decided, after investigating everything accurately anew, to write it down in an orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may realize the certainty of the teachings you have received” (Lk 1:3-4). The evangelist seems to be well aware that his writings offer a specific form of instruction that can give firm assurance to those already baptized. The Apostle Paul, for his part, tells the Galatians that: “one who is being instructed in the word should share all good things with his instructor” (Gal 6:6). As is evident, this text provides yet another detail; it speaks of the communion of life as a sign of the fruitfulness of an authentic catechesis.\n\n2. From the beginning, the Christian community was characterized by many different forms of ministry carried out by men and women who, obedient to the working of the Holy Spirit, devoted their lives to the building up of the Church. At times, the charisms that the Spirit constantly pours out on the baptized took on a visible and tangible form of immediate service to the Christian community, one recognized as an indispensable diakonia for the community. The Apostle Paul authoritatively attests to this when he states that “there are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit; there are different forms of service but the same Lord; there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit. To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit; to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing them individually to each person as he wishes” (1 Cor 12:4-11).\n\nWithin the broader charismatic tradition of the New Testament, then, we can see that certain baptized persons exercised the ministry of transmitting in a more organic and stable form related to different situations in life the teaching of the apostles and evangelists (cf. SECOND VATICAN ECUMENICAL COUNCIL, Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation Dei Verbum, 8). The Church wished to acknowledge this service as a concrete expression of a personal charism that contributed greatly to the exercise of her mission of evangelization. This glance at the life of the first Christian communities engaged in the spread of the Gospel also encourages the Church in our day to appreciate possible new ways for her to remain faithful to the word of the Lord so that his Gospel can be preached to every creature.\n\n3. The history of evangelization over the past two millennia clearly shows the effectiveness of the mission of catechists. Bishops, priests and deacons, together with many men and women in the consecrated life, devoted their lives to catechetical instruction so that the faith might be an effective support for the life of every human being. Some of them also gathered around themselves others of their brothers and sisters sharing the same charism, and founded religious orders wholly dedicated to catechesis.\n\nNor can we forget the countless lay men and women who directly took part in the spread of the Gospel through catechetical instruction. Men and women of deep faith, authentic witnesses of holiness, who in some cases were also founders of Churches and eventually died as martyrs. In our own day too, many competent and dedicated catechists are community leaders in various parts of the world and carry out a mission invaluable for the transmission and growth of the faith. The long line of blesseds, saints and martyrs who were catechists has significantly advanced the Church’s mission and deserves to be recognized, for it represents a rich resource not only for catechesis but also for the entire history of Christian spirituality.\n\n4. Beginning with the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, the Church has come to a renewed appreciation of the importance of lay involvement in the work of evangelization. The Council Fathers repeatedly emphasized the great need for the lay faithful to be engaged directly, in the various ways their charism can be expressed, in the “plantatio Ecclesiae” and the development of the Christian community. “Worthy of praise too is that army of catechists, both men and women, to whom missionary work among the nations is so indebted, who imbued with an apostolic spirit make an outstanding and absolutely necessary contribution to the spread of the faith and the Church by their great work. In our days, when there are so few clerics to evangelize such great multitudes and to carry out the pastoral ministry, the role of catechists is of the highest importance” (cf. SECOND VATICAN ECUMENICAL COUNCIL, Decree on the Church’s Missionary Activity Ad Gentes, 17).\n\nAlong with the important teaching of the Council, mention should be made of the constant interest of the Popes, the Synod of Bishops, the Episcopal Conferences and individual Bishops who, in recent decades have contributed to a significant renewal of catechesis. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Apostolic Exhortation Catechesi Tradendae, the General Catechetical Directory, the General Directory for Catechesis and the recent Directory for Catechesis, as well as the many national, regional and diocesan Catechisms, have confirmed the centrality of a catechesis that gives priority to the education and ongoing formation of believers.\n\n5. Without prejudice to the Bishop’s mission as the primary catechist in his Diocese, one which he shares with his presbyterate, or to the particular responsibility of parents for the Christian formation of their children (cf. CIC can. 774 §2; CCEO can. 618), recognition should be given to those lay men and women who feel called by virtue of their baptism to cooperate in the work of catechesis (cf. CIC can. 225; CCEO cans. 401 and 406). This presence is all the more urgently needed today as a result of our increasing awareness of the need for evangelization in the contemporary world (cf. Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium, 163-168), and the rise of a globalized culture (cf. Encyclical Letter Fratelli Tutti, 100, 138). This requires genuine interaction with young people, to say nothing of the need for creative methodologies and resources capable of adapting the proclamation of the Gospel to the missionary transformation that the Church has undertaken. Fidelity to the past and responsibility for the present are necessary conditions for the Church to carry out her mission in the world.\n\nAwakening personal enthusiasm on the part of all the baptized and reviving the awareness of their call to carry out a proper mission in the community demands attentiveness to the voice of the Spirit, who is unfailingly present and fruitful (cf. CIC can. 774 §1; CCEO can. 617). Today, too, the Spirit is calling men and women to set out and encounter all those who are waiting to discover the beauty, goodness, and truth of the Christian faith. It is the task of pastors to support them in this process and to enrich the life of the Christian community through the recognition of lay ministries capable of contributing to the transformation of society through the “penetration of Christian values into the social, political and economic sectors” (Evangelii Gaudium, 102).\n\n6. The lay apostolate is unquestionably “secular”. It requires that the laity “seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and directing them according to God’s will” (cf. SECOND VATICAN ECUMENICAL COUNCIL Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium, 31). In their daily life, interwoven with family and social relationships, the laity come to realize that they “are given this special vocation: to make the Church present and fruitful in those places and circumstances where it is only through them that she can become the salt of the earth” (ibid., 33). We do well to remember, however, that in addition to this apostolate, “the laity can be called in different ways to more immediate cooperation in the apostolate of the hierarchy, like those men and women who helped the apostle Paul in the Gospel, working hard in the Lord” (ibid.).\n\nThe role played by catechists is one specific form of service among others within the Christian community. Catechists are called first to be expert in the pastoral service of transmitting the faith as it develops through its different stages from the initial proclamation of the kerygma to the instruction that presents our new life in Christ and prepares for the sacraments of Christian initiation, and then to the ongoing formation that can allow each person to give an accounting of the hope within them (cf. 1 Pet 3:15). At the same time, every catechist must be a witness to the faith, a teacher and mystagogue, a companion and pedagogue, who teaches for the Church. Only through prayer, study, and direct participation in the life of the community can they grow in this identity and the integrity and responsibility that it entails (cf. Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelization, Directory for Catechesis, 113).\n\n7. With great foresight, Saint Paul VI issued the Apostolic Letter Ministeria Quaedam with the intention not only of adapting the ministries of Lector and Acolyte to changed historical circumstances (cf. Apostolic Letter Spiritus Domini), but also of encouraging Episcopal Conferences to promote other ministries, including that of Catechist. “In addition to the ministries common to the entire Latin Church, nothing prevents Episcopal Conferences from asking the Apostolic See for the institution of others, which for particular reasons, they consider necessary or very useful in their own region. Among these are, for example, the offices of Porter, Exorcist and Catechist.” The same pressing invitation is found in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi; in calling for a discernment of the present needs of the Christian community in faithful continuity with its origins, the Pope encouraged the development of new forms of ministry for a renewed pastoral activity. “Such ministries, apparently new but closely tied up with the Church’s living experience down the centuries, such as that of catechists… are valuable for the establishment, life, and growth of the Church, and for her capacity to influence her surroundings and to reach those who are remote from her” (SAINT PAUL VI, Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi, 73).\n\nTo be sure, “there has been a growing awareness of the identity and mission of the laity in the Church. We can indeed count on many lay persons, although still not nearly enough, who have a deeply-rooted sense of community and great fidelity to the tasks of charity, catechesis and the celebration of the faith” (Evangelii Gaudium, 102). It follows that the reception of a lay ministry such as that of Catechist will emphasize even more the missionary commitment proper to every baptized person, a commitment that must however be carried out in a fully “secular” manner, avoiding any form of clericalization.\n\n8. This ministry has a definite vocational aspect, as evidenced by the Rite of Institution, and consequently calls for due discernment on the part of the Bishop. It is in fact a stable form of service rendered to the local Church in accordance with pastoral needs identified by the local Ordinary, yet one carried out as a work of the laity, as demanded by the very nature of the ministry. It is fitting that those called to the instituted ministry of Catechist be men and women of deep faith and human maturity, active participants in the life of the Christian community, capable of welcoming others, being generous and living a life of fraternal communion. They should also receive suitable biblical, theological, pastoral and pedagogical formation to be competent communicators of the truth of the faith and they should have some prior experience of catechesis (cf. SECOND VATICAN ECUMENICAL COUNCIL, Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops in the Church Christus Dominus, 14; CIC can. 231 §1; CCEO can. 409 §1). It is essential that they be faithful co-workers with priests and deacons, prepared to exercise their ministry wherever it may prove necessary, and motivated by true apostolic enthusiasm.\n\nTherefore, after having taken all things into consideration, and by apostolic authorityThe Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments will soon publish the Rite of Institution of the lay ministry of Catechist.\n\n9. I invite the Episcopal Conferences to render effective the ministry of Catechist, determining the necessary process of formation and the normative criteria for admission to this ministry and devising the most appropriate forms for the service which these men and women will be called to exercise in conformity with the content of this Apostolic Letter.\n\n10. The Synods of the Oriental Churches or the Assemblies of Hierarchs may adopt what is established here for their respective Churches sui iuris, in accordance with their particular law.\n\n11. Bishops should make every effort to comply with the exhortation of the Council Fathers: “Pastors… know that they were not established by Christ to undertake by themselves the entire saving mission of the Church to the world. They appreciate, rather, that it is their exalted task to shepherd the faithful and at the same time acknowledge their ministries and charisms so that all in their separate ways, but of one mind, may cooperate in the common task” (Lumen Gentium, 30). May the discernment of the gifts that the Holy Spirit never fails to grant to the Church sustain their efforts to make the lay ministry of Catechist effective for the growth of their communities.\n\nI order that what has been laid down by this Apostolic Letter issued “Motu Proprio” have firm and stable effect, anything to the contrary notwithstanding, even if worthy of special mention, and that it be promulgated by publication in L’Osservatore Romano, taking effect that same day, and published thereafter in the official commentary of the Acta Apostolicae Sedis.",

She also called for \"robust surveillance\" of variants, and for the sharing of scientific data to help stop the spread.\n\nLetters will refer to both variants of concern, and variants of interest. A full list of names has been published on the WHO website.\n\nThese Greek letters will not replace existing scientific names. If more than 24 variants are officially identified, the system runs out of Greek letters, and a new naming programme will be announced, Ms Van Kerkhove told STAT News in an interview.\n\n\"We're not saying replace B.1.1.7, but really just to try to help some of the dialogue with the average person,\" she told the US-based website. \"So that in public discourse, we could discuss some of these variants in more easy-to-use language.\"On Monday, a scientist advising the UK government said the country was in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus infections, in part driven by the Delta, or Indian variant.\n\nIt is thought to spread more quickly than the Alpha (UK; Kent) variant, which was responsible for the surge in cases in the UK over the winter.\n\nVietnam, meanwhile, has detected what appears to be a combination of those two variants. On Saturday, the country's health minister said it could spread quickly through the air and described it as \"very dangerous\".",

    "content": "The white Fort Worth police officer accused of shooting a black woman inside her home over the weekend, killing her, has been jailed on a murder charge, online court records revealed Monday.\n\nThe murder charge against Aaron Dean was made public hours after the officer resigned from the force. Bond was set at $200,000.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, 28, was gunned down early Saturday after police were summoned to her Fort Worth home to conduct a welfare check by a neighbor who reported seeing Jefferson's front door open. Bodycam footage released by police showed two officers canvassing the property before one officer, later identified by investigators as Dean, shouted, \"put your hands up, show me your hands,\" and fired through a window.\n\nJefferson's family was \"relieved\" that Dean was behind bars, attorney Lee Merritt said, adding that the family \"needs to see this through to a vigorous prosecution and appropriate sentencing.\"\n\nInterim Police Chief Ed Kraus announced Monday that Dean was placed on detached duty and stripped of his badge and firearm after he was served with his written administrative complaint yesterday.\n\n\"My intent was to meet with him today to terminate his employment with the Fort Worth Police Department. However, the officer tendered his resignation this morning before we met,\" Kraus told reporters Monday. \"Even though he no longer works for the city, we will continue the administrative investigation as if he did. The case will be completed and reviewed by the chain of command.\n\nNEIGHBOR WHO CALLED 911 ABOUT JEFFERSON’S HOME SAYS ‘ALL THEY NEEDED TO DO IS RING THE DOORBELL’\"Had the officer not resigned I would have fired him for violations of several policies including our use of force policy, our de-escalation policy and unprofessional conduct,\" Kraus added.\n\nMayor Betsy Price, appearing next to Kraus, said Jefferson was \"unjustly taken from her family\" and that city leadership has set in place motions to bring a \"third party panel of national experts\" in to review the city's police department.\n\n\"To Atatiana's family: It’s unacceptable,\" she said. \"There is nothing that could justify what happened on Saturday morning. Nothing.\"\n\nKraus also said he expected a \"substantial update\" by tomorrow on whether criminal charges will be filed against Dean.\n\nDean's letter read: \"Effective immediately I am tendering my resignation from the Fort Worth Police Department.\" The letter was released by the state's largest police union, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas. The group’s executive director, Charley Wilkison, said that Dean has not yet hired an attorney but that one will be provided with financial support from the union.\n\nTEXAS MAN WHO SAID COPS WOULDN'T FIND HIM IS FOUND, ARRESTED ON BURGLARY CHARGE\n\nThe shooting also has led politicians to question the officer's use of force.\n\n\"It seems like this police officer made a very quick judgment to shoot her through this window and that makes absolutely no sense at all,\" Rep. Marc Veasey, a Democrat, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Sunday night during a candlelight vigil at Jefferson’s home, which hundreds of people reportedly attended.\n\n\"Our welfare check turned into a death, and that should never have happened,\" Fort Worth City Councilwoman Kelly Allen Gray told the newspaper. \"Our people, our citizens who call the police, should know the police are going to come and answer their cares and concerns in a way that does not result in a tragedy.\"Fort Worth police said in a statement that after \"perceiving a threat, the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot, striking the person inside the residence.\" Officers then entered the house, located a firearm and started performing emergency medical care, investigators said.\n\nThe department released bodycam footage of the incident \"to provide transparent and relevant information to the public as we are allowed within the confines of the\" investigation, it stated. Any video taken inside the house could not be distributed due to state law.\n\nHowever, the bodycam video released to media included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom at the home, The Associated Press reported. It's unclear if the firearm was found near Jefferson, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she had a gun.\n\nPolice Lt. Brandon O’Neil said yesterday afternoon that the officer had been on the force since April 2018. At a brief news conference at police headquarters, O’Neil confirmed that the officer did not announce he was a police officer before he fired the deadly shot and that the failure to do so was part of the department’s investigation.\n\nAMBER GUYGER SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IN SHOOTING THAT KILLED BOTHAM JEAN IN DALLAS\n\nO’Neil also said Jefferson's 8-year-old nephew was in the room with Jefferson when she was shot. He said representatives of the police department have spoken with the woman's family and \"shared our serious and heartfelt concern for this unspeakable loss.\" Jefferson's family members have said she was watching her nephew at the time.\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Officers Association, in a statement released to media, announced it was \"urging the Fort Worth police department to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation, and through that investigation, we hope to gain clarity and understanding of what exactly transpired.\"\n\n\"Police officers take an oath to protect and serve all citizens in our great city and it is every officers’ worst fear to use deadly force in the line of duty,\" it added. \"We are thankful for our community leaders who seek to unite during times of grief instead of divide and we hope that collaboration and peace will help guide us forward.\"\n\nJefferson was a 2014 graduate of Xavier University in New Orleans and earned a bachelor's degree in biology, the university said.\n\n\"Our prayers and thoughts are with her family and friends as we gather as a community in prayer,\" President Reynold Verret said in a letter to the Xavier community. \"As we wait for details of this incident to unfold, let us cling to our mission of justice and humanity and seek answers to this tragedy.\"\n\nHer sister, Amber Carr, described the shooting as \"another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"You know, you want to see justice,\" she told KXAS, \"but justice don’t bring my sister back.\"\n\nAnother one of her sisters, Ashley Carr, described Atatiana Monday as a \"smart, ambitious, kind person with a nurturing spirit\" that \"any parent would be proud to call her their daughter.\"\n\nFox News’ Mike Arroyo, Louis Casiano, Melissa Leon and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "content": "OCHA and humanitarian partners are providing aid as people continue to flee fighting in the Kivus.\nHumanitarian agencies in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are providing basic support as the number of displaced people across the country reaches 2 million for the first time in nearly three years.\n\nOver the past nine months, the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in DRC has grown steadily, mainly due to persisting insecurity in North and South Kivu Provinces. In February 2012, the Congolese army launched operations against armed groups that were traumatizing civilians in the east. In retaliation, these armed groups stepped up their violent attacks against civilians.\n\n“The army’s aim of providing peace and security to civilians is creating a boomerang effect, so these same civilians are paying a heavy price. Humanitarian agencies are on the ground providing aid, and we will need to scale up this aid if the situation further deteriorates,” warned Barbara Shenstone, Head of OCHA in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa.\n\nSouth Kivu has recorded the biggest increase in the number of displaced people—up 35 per cent from 635,000 IDPs at the end of last year to more than 856,000 at the end of March 2012. Its neighbour, North Kivu, has seen a smaller increase of 10 per cent to over 547,000 IDPs. This number may increase, as a recent stand-off between the national army and troops who have defected is spiraling out of control. This has already pushed large numbers of people onto the roads, including almost 7,000 who have crossed the border into Rwanda since 29 April.With 1.4 million IDPs, the Kivus account for 70 per cent of the total displaced population in DRC. Some of those displaced fled their homes many years ago while others have been forced from their homes several times.\n\nThe Rapid Response to Population Movement (RRMP) programme is an aid mechanism run by OCHA and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) that serves as a first line of response. In the past few months, the RRMP has stepped up its work in both Kivu Provinces. Thousands of displaced households have received help through the programme’s aid fairs—where people receive tokens in exchange for items such as food—and through more traditional aid distributions. In addition, the World Food Programme (WFP) is distributing high-energy biscuits to newly displaced households.\n\nIn March, the NGOs Norwegian Refugee Council and Solidarités International distributed aid directly or through fairs to some 35,000 displaced and returnee households and host families. These distributions were also carried out under the RRMP banner. In Walikale, North Kivu, some 7,500 IDPs benefited from a cash-transfer-for-food programme in March. In South Kivu, the International Rescue Committee and the Italian Foundation, Association of Volunteers and International Service assisted some 25,000 IDPs in Bitale and Nyamirera. WFP also intends to use cash tranfers as the primary mechanism for meeting the needs of newly displaced households in areas where market assessments show this is feasible.\n\nIn late March, WFP, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and UNICEF appealed for US$4 million to help some 16,000 IDPs in Mitwaba, Katanga.\n\nFunding requirements for DRC in 2012 are $718m; by 14 May, only $223m had been received.  Aid agencies estimate that if the situation continues to deteriorate, more money will be needed.\n\nFor Kojo Anyanful, the DRC WFP Country Director ad interim, his priority is clear: \"To ensure the continued delivery of life-saving food assistance to 1.8 million victims of armed conflict and other vulnerable people through the end of 2012, WFP urgently requires $34 million,” he said. “This includes assistance to those who have been displaced by conflict for some time, as well as the newly displaced.\"",

On Thursday, the 42-year-old was one of about 200 people wearing face masks and standing 6 feet apart in the Clark County Government Center’s outdoor amphitheater for the ceremony.\n\n“That night I lost a part of me, and I come back looking for it,” Soto said, with tears in her eyes.\n\nSince October 2017, Soto has moved from California to Minneapolis and has started her dream job as a flight attendant. She said that she decided to “live life to the fullest” for those who died in the attack.\n\nA slideshow during the ceremony displayed the names and pictures of the 58 people killed that night. The pictures of two women who died within the past year of injuries they suffered in the mass shooting were included at the end with a message reading, “In Memoriam of 1 October Victims Lost in the Last Year.”At the end of the ceremony, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced that the two women, Kimberly Gervais of Mira Loma, California, and Samanta Arjune of Las Vegas, will be added to the official death toll, raising the number from 58 to 60.\n\nThe announcement came after the Review-Journal on Monday published an article that highlighted their deaths and reported the Metropolitan Police Department’s initial decision not to include them in the death total.“It isn’t like we’re trying to avoid the names,” Lombardo said in a brief interview after the ceremony. He later added that, “At this point, I think I’m comfortable in acknowledging that the other two individuals lost their lives as a result of 1 October.”\n\nThere were fewer people at the ceremony this year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced officials to limit the number of people who could attend. Gov. Steve Sisolak, who also addressed the crowd, said that when he raised the limit on public gatherings this week, Thursday’s event was one of his “biggest priorities.”Sisolak’s voice grew shaky as he recalled that night and offered his condolences to the family members of those who died.\n\n“We will never, never forget what happened that day, or the lives that were lost, and the lives that were changed,” he said.\n\nAlbert Rivera, the father of Jordyn Rivera, who was 21 when she was killed in the attack, said he was thankful to all the survivors who continue to come together on the anniversary and support each other.\n\n“We are all a statistic — we are all part of this unwanted fraternity we didn’t chose to be a part of,” he said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged Greg Zanis, an Illinois carpenter who built 58 crosses honoring those who died in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Zanis died in May of terminal bladder cancer, and Rivera said he will “be forever changed” by Zanis’ kindness.\n\nHe ended his remarks by calling for unity during what he said has been a time of divisiveness in the U.S. He urged people to remember how they came together on Oct. 2, 2017.\n\n“It’s said that it takes more effort to hate than to love. Let’s remember that,” he said. “Until we meet again — here, there or in the air — may we all smile like Jordyn.”",

It comes after weeks of deadlock with the government intransigent over meeting an original 50% pay rise demanded by the unions that it said would strain the heavily indebted country’s finances.\n\nOfficials said King Abdullah had ordered the government to reach the hefty wage deal which tests the ability of Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz to stay on track in implementing tough fiscal reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimed at reducing a record $40 billion public debt.\n\nThe government fears new pay demands by other public sector employees, including doctors, and pension increases for retired soldiers would wreck efforts to restore fiscal prudence needed for a sustained economic recovery.\n\nDozens of activists from the powerful teachers union, whose members succeeded in forcing the government to agree to substantial pay hikes after a four-week standoff, celebrated in front of their headquarters in Amman.\n\n“The teachers got their demands,” said Nasser Al Nawasrah, deputy head of the Jordanian Teachers Syndicate. He called on his organization’s 100,000 members to immediately resume teaching pupils in around 4,000 state schools that had been affected by the strike.\n\nTens of thousands of pupils headed to state school across the country on Sunday for the first time since Sept. 5. The unions announced the strike after the authorities used tear gas to disperse thousands of teachers who had congregated to press for the wage demands near government headquarters.\n\nMany parents had kept their children at home out of solidarity with the striking teachers.\n\nIn many of the country’s rural areas and smaller cities, traditional heartlands of support for the monarchy, the strike also became a protest against successive governments’ failure to deliver on promises of economic growth.\n\nGrowing disenchantment among ordinary Jordanians over tough IMF austerity measures and high taxes spilled into large street protests in the summer of 2018 that railed against corruption and mismanagement of public funds.\n\nEconomists and experts said the teachers’ strike exposed popular anger with deep disparities within a bloated public sector that has in the last two decades expanded rapidly as successive governments sought to appease Jordanians with state jobs to maintain stability.\n\nThe teachers, whose average salary is around 450 dinars ($630) per month, said they have fallen behind others in many government ministries and state agencies plagued by graft and nepotism.\n\nThe IMF and Western donors said salaries and pensions eat up much of the government’s $13 billion budget in a country with some of the world’s highest government spending relative to its economy.",

This project accomplishes our mission beautifully,” said FIU President Mark B. Rosenberg. “We are filled with pride and satisfaction at seeing this engineering feat come to life and connect our campus to the surrounding community where thousands of our students live.”\n\nUsing an innovative approach to bridge construction, the main span, which weighs 950 tons, was built next to Southwest 8th Street.\n\nThis technique reduced potential risks to workers, commuters and pedestrians and prevented traffic tie-ups in the area.The move was the largest pedestrian bridge move via Self-Propelled Modular Transportation, in U.S. history.\n\n“FIU has come a long way since the TIGER grant that funded this pedestrian bridge was awarded in 2013. This project represents a true collaboration among so many different partners at local, state, and federal levels, and in both the public and private sectors,” said Mario Diaz-Balart, U.S. Representative and Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development. “The university’s growth and acceleration is no longer just about the campus and its student body; it’s about the future of Sweetwater, Miami-Dade County and the entire South Florida region. I believe this is what creative solutions to transportation challenges look like, and I will continue to support and incentivize these new ideas.”\n\nFunding for the $14.2 million bridge, connecting plazas and walkways is part of a $19.4 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nOther funding agencies include the Federal Highway Administration, Florida Department of Transportation Local Agency Program, FIU and the City of Sweetwater.\n\n“The FIU-Sweetwater bridge will serve many purposes including being a visually distinctive gateway to our city,” said City of Sweetwater Mayor Orlando Lopez. “This bridge is symbolic of the growth our city is experiencing and our partnership with FIU.”\n\nThe moving of the bridge began at 5 a.m. and took approximately five hours.\n\nMORE NEWS:\nFired Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Larry Scirotto Speaks Out\nThe project includes the bridge, sidewalks and a plaza. Construction began in the spring of 2017 and is expected to be completed in early 2019.",

So, WFP has adjusted its program to try to cater [for] the needs, the emergency food needs, of these people. ... Our monthly food ration covers 80% of the basic food needs of a family of five.\"\n\nAs the insurgency and the number of its victims expand, concerns about the displaced are growing.\n\nBorges Nhamire of Mozambique's Center for Public Integrity — which promotes democracy and human rights — said the government needs to do more for displaced civilians in Cabo Delgado.\n\nPeople are fleeing using their own means and the government does not have any logistics in place to evacuate people from conflict zones to safer areas like Pemba, he said. The government is there to receive refugees, he added, but they end up living with host families because there is no place to sleep.Cabo Delgado's fast-growing Islamist threat was underscored when local media reported in November the insurgents killed scores of people in a series of brutal attacks.\n\nMozambique's state media reported militants in Muatide village rounded up more than 50 people, mostly young men, and beheaded them on a football pitch.\n\nIn April, local media reported militants shot or beheaded 52 young people in Muidumb district after they refused to join their ranks.\n\nMozambican National Defense Minister Jaime Neto told Radio Mozambique last month that they are fighting to eliminate the Islamist threat, adding that people must be patient and trust the security and defense forces.\n\nCabo Delgado has vast oil and gas deposits estimated to be worth $60 billion. Due to the threats from militants, though, development of the natural resource has been slow.\n\nThe Islamist attacks began in October 2017 when armed men overran police stations in Mocimboa da Praia. The insurgents and military have been fighting for territory ever since, leaving up to 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.",

    "content": "Over the past year, key U.S. allies South Korea and Japan have been embroiled in a political and trade dispute which has many antecedents in the past, but which has been exacerbated by more recent developments. At the heart of the dispute is South Korea’s continued push for restitution for Japan’s World War II–era transgressions, claims Japan contends were settled in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations. However, from November 2018 to June 2019, a series of South Korean court rulings awarded compensation from Japanese companies to forced wartime laborers and their families, reopening long-standing tensions between the two nations on this issue.\n\nThen, in July 2019, Japan removed South Korea from a “white list” of countries accorded preferential treatment for export licensing. Japanese officials initially appeared to justify the restrictions as a response to alleged South Korean violations of United Nations prohibitions against exporting certain materials to North Korea. Later, Japanese officials explained that the “relationship of trust” with regard to South Korea’s export control and regulation procedures had been “significantly undermined” due to Seoul’s refusal to participate in working-level export-control talks for three years. Regardless of the true reason (or reasons), South Korea’s removal from Japan’s white list was seen by many as a response to simmering tensions—and moreover as a direct threat to South Korea’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector.\n\nMore than 1,100 products were potentially exposed to enhanced Japanese regulatory scrutiny when South Korea was removed from the white list. But three chemicals or components key to semiconductor manufacturing were of particular concern to South Korea: hydrogen fluoride, fluorinated polyimide, and photoresists. This matters, because Japanese vendors account for 90 percent of the world’s supply of fluorinated polyimide and photoresists and 70 percent of global hydrogen fluoride production. Moreover, Japan supplies 90 percent of South Korea’s fluorinated polyimide and photoresist imports and 44 percent of its hydrogen fluoride imports.\n\nThis has greatly concerned South Korea, because the semiconductor sector is foundational to its economy. Korea is the world’s second-largest semiconductor manufacturer, led by Samsung and SK Hynix, which are the world’s second and fourth-largest semiconductor producers, respectively. Moreover, Korea remains an export-led economy (the world’s fifth most export-intensive, in fact), and semiconductors or related equipment account for fully one-third of Korea’s exports, 92 percent of its export growth in 2018, and 80 percent of its current account surplus (trade balance) in that year.\n\nAnd while the relative value of South Korean imports of these three inputs from Japan is relatively small—just $33.6 million worth of these three chemicals each month—South Korea exports $8.4 billion worth of semiconductors each month that depend on those chemicals. This means that South Korea’s export-loss exposure is 250 times greater than that of Japan’s chemical manufacturers, and thus that South Korea has much more to lose in this dispute.\n\nOf course, it’s not just South Korea’s semiconductor and broader ICT sector that’s potentially exposed. LG appliances along with Hyundai and Kia cars increasingly depend on semiconductors, many of which are produced in South Korea. (In fact, digital and electronic components now account for as much as 40 percent of the inputs in global automotive production.) In short, if Japan were to aggressively restrict or delay the export of these key chemicals to South Korea, it could have a dramatic impact across South Korea’s entire economy. So much so that one market analyst wrote last fall that, “the downside risk of the ongoing trade dispute may reduce South Korean GDP by as much as 2.6% in 2020.”\n\nBut there’s much at stake for Japan as well. As a U.S. International Trade Commission report on the dispute, “The South Korea-Japan Trade Dispute in Context: Semiconductor Manufacturing, Chemicals, and Concentrated Supply Chains,” noted, “Japan’s actions create incentives for Korean chipmakers to significantly lessen their sourcing from Japanese suppliers, not only in specialized chemicals, but throughout the entire semiconductor supply chain.” Indeed, SK Hynix has already begun switching to domestic sourcing of hydrogen fluoride, and LG is reportedly testing Taiwanese hydrogen fluoride as a replacement for Japanese product. Moreover, over 11 percent of Japan’s exports to South Korea are in the semiconductor sector, so if Japan harms South Korea’s semiconductor sector, it could end up unwittingly harming its own ICT firms. However, it’s consumer-facing Japanese sectors such as automotive, retail, tourism, and beer that have been hardest hit by the dispute thus far. For instance, Japanese automotive exports to Korea fell by 60 percent from April to September 2019. And in terms of country share of South Korean imports of foreign beer, the Japanese share fell from 16 percent to 1.5 percent last year, while Asahi beer fell from being one of the most popular foreign beers in South Korea to 36th.\n\nAs 2020 begins, however, it appears tensions have cooled down somewhat. A mid-December meeting between senior Japanese and South Korean trade officials lasted hours longer than expected and resulted in the two sides reporting they had reached “common ground” and agreeing to hold another dialogue in Seoul in the near future. To be sure, the situation remains sensitive, and the lack of South Korea’s inclusion on Japan’s white list has generated significant uncertainty for Korean companies. However, Japan has been approving recent export requests for the key chemicals in question on a timely and expeditious basis. So long as this continues, it would allay concerns that Japan could use the export controls to inhibit the competitiveness of South Korea’s semiconductor industry and disrupt global semiconductor supply chains more broadly.\n\nWhat the Japan-Korea Trade Dispute Means for the United States\nWhile certainly concerning, the trade dispute in some ways has presented an opportunity for the United States to assert renewed diplomatic engagement in the region. While the United States stayed on the sidelines for most of the summer and fall of 2019, pressure from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in November played a pivotal role in persuading South Korea to not withdraw from the GSOMIA (General Sharing of Military Information Agreement), an intelligence-sharing agreement among the three nations which has played a critical role in monitoring Chinese and North Korean military activities and has provided a “pillar of stability” for regional security issues.\n\nU.S. engagement in the region is crucial, particularly as there’s a battle now being fought for the soul of the global economic and trading system. It’s a contest of competing visions: On one hand, China’s model of state-directed capitalism predicated on an aggressive innovation mercantilism that distorts markets through a vast array of unfair trade practices ranging from forced intellectual property (IP) theft, to forced IP and tech transfer as a condition of market access, to excessive industrial subsidization. On the other hand, liberal democracies that embrace rules-governed, market-based, private enterprise–led trade in accordance with the fundamental World Trade Organization tenets of reciprocity, non-discrimination, and national treatment.\n\nThe United States must working with its like-minded allies not just to confront China on its unfair trade practices—as ITIF argues in a new paper earlier this week, “Why and How to Mount a Strong, Trilateral Response to China’s Innovation Mercantilism”—but also to ensure the vibrancy of market-led capitalism, in part by pursuing higher-standard trade agreements with both Japan and South Korea, as the Trump administration has done with both nations. Ideally, the United States also would reengage in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and bring all three nations into the fold of a high-standard Pacific region trade agreement. The U.S. Department of Commerce should also hold a working-level meeting with Japanese and South Korean officials on export controls.\n\nIn fact, the only winner in an ongoing Japan-South Korea trade dispute would be China, partly because of the wedge it would drive among key U.S. allies and in partly because a continuing dispute would harm Korean and Japanese firms, which represent key competitors to Chinese ones. Disruptions to global ICT supply chains will only further China’s ambitions to achieve autarky, or domestic capacity, across every facet of semiconductor production. Moreover, the ongoing dispute detracts from Korea and Japan focusing, along with the United States, on what really matters: rolling back Chinese innovation mercantilism.\n\nHowever, the United States also needs to engage to ensure an amicable resolution is reached in order to maintain confidence in globalization of both semiconductor supply chains and the broader cause of liberalized, market-based trade. Of course, beyond the economic concerns lie serious national and global security issues, particularly regarding North Korea, and here as well the United States needs to present a united front with its closest Asian allies to effectively address security challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, there’s a tremendous amount at stake for Japan, Korea, the United States, and China in this dispute. For the United States, it’s an opportunity to reassert leadership and engagement in the Asia-Pacific region and to deepen ties with critical allies it needs both to assure regional security stability and to present a concerted front against China’s expansive, state-led capitalism. For South Korea and Japan, much is at stake for their own economies and for the preservation of global supply chains and liberalized trade on which their export-dependent economies rely.",

The Parler website was not accessible early on Monday.\nBuzzFeed News was first to report the move. Parler is an alternative social network popular with conservatives and has been heavily used by supporters of President Donald Trump, including some who participated in Wednesday's US Capitol unrest.\nIn a letter obtained by CNN Business that was sent to Parler Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff on Saturday, Amazon Web Services said that in recent weeks it has reported 98 examples to Parler of \"posts that clearly encourage and incite violence.\" The letter includes screenshots of several examples.\n\"We've seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms,\" AWS wrote. \"It's clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.\"\nThe letter continued: \"AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler's account.\"\nThe sweep threatens to cut Parler off from its entire audience. Not only will new users be unable to find Parler on the internet's two largest app stores, even those who've already downloaded the app will be unable to use it because it will be unable to communicate with Parler's servers on AWS.\nIndeed, Parler CEO John Matze warned that the deplatforming could lead to service interruptions.\nAfter Amazon boots the company from its web hosting service, Parler's website could be offline for as long as a week while \"we rebuild from scratch,\" Matze said in a post on his platform.\n\"We will try our best to move to a new provider right now as we have many competing for our business,\" Matze continued.\nMatze accused Amazon of trying to \"completely remove free speech off the internet.\"\nThe revelation of Amazon's decision came soon after Apple removed Parler from its app store.\n\"[T]here is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity,\" the iPhone maker said of its move.\nApple notified Parler of its decision in a message that said it had violated the company's app store terms.\n\"The processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient,\" Apple told Parler. \"Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 - Safety - Objectionable Content.\"\nApple's notice said Parler's responses to an earlier warning were inadequate, including Parler's defense that it had been taking violent rhetoric on its platform \"very seriously for weeks\" and that it had a moderation plan \"for the time being,\" according to Apple.\n\"Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people's safety,\" Apple said in a statement to CNN Business. \"We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues.\"\nApple's decision followed a similar move by Google on Friday to drop Parler from the Google Play Store.\nMatze wrote in a message on his platform that Apple \"will be banning Parler until we give up free speech, institute broad and invasive policies like Twitter and Facebook and we become a surveillance platform by pursuing guilt of those who use Parler before innocence.\"\n\"They claim it is due to violence on the platform,\" Matze wrote of Apple, whom he also accused of being a \"software monopoly,\" a particularly relevant attack right now given an ongoing antitrust suit against Apple from Fortnite maker Epic Games. \"The community disagrees as we hit number 1 on their store today.\"\nMatze promised to share \"more details about our next plans coming soon as we have many options.\"",

More than 238,000 people either evacuated or were ready to go as more thunderstorms threatened to light new fires yesterday afternoon, according to officials.\n\nStill-active fires are affecting at least 23 counties in Northern California, stretching from Butte to Fresno. Two of the blazes rank among the largest in state history.The LNU Lightning Complex Fire, a group of fires centered in Napa and Sonoma counties, has grown into the second-largest blaze ever seen in California. The SCU Lightning Complex Fire, a cluster of blazes in Santa Clara, Alameda and nearby counties, is the third-largest.\n\nAltogether, the fires have burned an area the size of Rhode Island.\n\n\"The scope [of the damage] is absolutely astonishing,\" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. It's \"hard to impress on people just how vast the acreage burned is, especially considering there were no strong offshore winds\" to drive the spread.\n\nPresident Trump on Saturday issued a major disaster declaration to fulfill a request by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to bolster the state's emergency resources. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for more thunderstorms and lightning through today.\n\nThe racing flames show how climate change is affecting the nation's most populous state, experts said. Hotter temperatures, less dependable precipitation and snowpack that melts sooner lead to drier soil and parched vegetation. Climate change also affects how much moisture is in the air, Swain said.\n\n\"It's actually drying out the air during these extreme heat events,\" which zaps plants of additional moisture, Swain said. That left much of the state a tinderbox when hundreds of lightning strikes scorched the countryside last week.\n\n\"This is really a testament to how dry the vegetation is, in terms of how quickly these fires spread when they were ignited by lightning,\" he said.\n\nThe amount of land burned last week is more than the total burned in all of 2018, and more than double the amount burned in 2017, according to data released by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).The fires on Saturday burned part of the oldest state park in California, Big Basin Redwoods State Park in Santa Cruz County. Flames damaged historic buildings, the campground and \"all of the infrastructure,\" said Christine McMorrow, a spokeswoman with Cal Fire. It wasn't known whether redwood trees were engulfed.\n\nThe blazes threaten to outpace the state's ability to respond. Nearly all of Cal Fire's crews are in the field, with some working 72-hour shifts. Oregon, Washington, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and other states sent firefighters, equipment or both. Officials said more than 13,000 fire personnel were on the scene.\"We have more people, but it's not enough,\" Newsom said at a Friday news conference. \"We have more air support, but it's not enough.\"\n\nREPEAT FIRE TRAUMA\nFires erupted beginning Aug. 15 when more than 1,200 lightning strikes hit the baking landscape within 72 hours.\n\nThose came \"the exact week that we were experiencing some of the hottest temperatures ever recorded in human history, 130-degree temperatures in the southern part of the state,\" Newsom said. It was \"maybe the hottest modern recorded temperature in the history of the world,\" he said.\n\nHe was referring to the temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit on Aug. 16 in Death Valley, a high not reached on Earth in 89 years. The highest temperature ever recorded on the planet is 134 Fahrenheit. It was reached in 1913 in Death Valley. Its accuracy is disputed by some observers because there was a lack of modern technology (Climatewire, Aug. 18).\n\nAltogether, more than 12,000 lightning strikes hit California last week, igniting over 600 fires. Firefighters knocked down smaller ones, but others merged into major \"complex\" fires.The week was filled with horror stories and heroic efforts. Volunteers helped evacuate senior citizens from a Vacaville retirement home in the middle of the night as a fire raced toward the facility. Others helped rescue \"dozens and dozens of individuals with intellectual disabilities\" in Santa Clara, Newsom said.\n\nHundreds saw their homes destroyed.\n\n\"Tuesday night when I went to bed, I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch,\" Hank Hanson, 81, of Vacaville, told the Associated Press. \"By Wednesday night, I have nothing but a bunch of ashes.\"\n\nState Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, who represents the Napa wine region, said at a news conference Friday that she has \"half a dozen really good friends who don't have a home right now.\"\n\nThe American Red Cross, wary of the coronavirus pandemic, put some survivors in hotel rooms so they could be separated from other evacuees, said Jim Burns, a Red Cross spokesman. Others went to evacuation shelters where protocols were in place to keep people spaced out. The Red Cross was also talking to colleges to see whether dorm rooms were available.\n\nThe fires swept across heavily populated cities that have endured major fires in recent years. Susan Gorin, a Sonoma County supervisor, lost her home in the 2017 Tubbs Fire, a blaze that killed 22 people. She built a new house in the same location; on Friday, she found ashes on her patio from a nearby firestorm.\n\n\"It just seems so terrifyingly familiar,\" Gorin said as she traveled to Lake Tahoe to escape the smoke and mayhem. \"This is now the third major fire in four years. We are battle-weary.\"\n\nCLIMATE CONNECTION SCRUTINIZED\nSwain with UCLA and other scientists earlier this year published a study that said climate change has doubled the number of extreme-risk days for California wildfires.\n\nIt said temperatures statewide rose 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since 1980, while precipitation dropped 30%. That doubled the number of autumn days that offer extreme conditions for the ignition of wildfires (Climatewire, April 3).\n\nThe heat is expected to get worse with time. Climate models estimate that average state temperatures will climb 3 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050 unless the world makes sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nEven with emissions cuts, average temperatures would rise 2 degrees by midcentury, he said.\n\nJon Keeley, a senior scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey Western Ecological Research Center, argued that the study from Swain and others failed to show that hotter temperatures are driving wildfires.\n\n\"Show us data that shows that level of temperature increase is actually associated with increased fire activity,\" Keeley said. \"They don't show that.\"\n\nKeeley added, \"We ought to be much more concerned with ignition sources than a 1- to 2-degree change in temperature.\"\n\nA big contributor to large California fires is that the state has focused on extinguishing blazes for about a century rather than allowing for controlled burns, he said. That has caused dead vegetation to accumulate.\n\nTrump has accused California of failing to \"sweep\" its forests, which he has linked to fires in the state.\n\nKeeley said that \"we don't sweep forests here in the U.S., but what we do is prescription burning. ... It's potentially the same thing. It's modifying the fuels prior to a fire.\"\n\nSwain, the UCLA climate scientist, said global warming is affecting how big fires get and how fast they move.\n\n\"What happens when they start burning, what is the character of those fires, and is it changing?\" Swain asked. \"The answer is yes.\"",

    "content": "A capsule containing the first significant quantities of rock from an asteroid is in \"perfect\" shape, according to scientists.\n\nThe container with material from a space rock called Ryugu parachuted down near Woomera in South Australia on Saturday evening (GMT).\n\nA recovery team in Australia found the spacecraft lying on the sandy ground, with its parachute draped over a bush.\n\nThe samples were originally collected by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa-2.\n\nThe spacecraft spent more than a year investigating Ryugu before returning to Earth. As it approached our planet, Hayabusa-2 released the capsule with the samples and fired its engines to push off in another direction.\n\nThe 16kg capsule, meanwhile, entered the Earth's atmosphere.The official Hayabusa-2 Twitter account reported that the capsule and its parachute had been found at 19:47 GMT.\n\n\"Hayabusa-2 is home,\" Dr Yuichi Tsuda, project manager for the mission, said at a press conference on Sunday morning (GMT) in Sagamihara, Japan.\n\n\"We collected the treasure box,\" he said, adding: \"The capsule collection was perfectly done.\"He said there was no damage to the container.Dr Hitoshi Kuninaka, director general of Japan's Institute for Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), said: \"We started development of Hayabusa-2 in 2011. I think the dream has come true.\"\n\nAddressing journalists, he acknowledged past missions that had experienced technical problems, but said: \"Regarding Hayabusa-2, we did everything according to the schedule - 100%. And we succeeded in sample return as planned. As a result, we can move on to the next stage in space development.\"\n\nThe next stage includes a mission called MMX, which will aim to bring back samples from Mars' largest moon Phobos.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the capsule was picked up by cameras as a dazzling fireball streaking over Australia's Coober Pedy region.\n\nScreaming towards Earth at 11km/s, it deployed parachutes to slow its descent. The capsule then began transmitting a beacon with information about its position.The spacecraft touched down on the vast Woomera range, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force.\n\nAt around 18:07 GMT (04:37 local time), the recovery team identified the position of the capsule on the ground. A helicopter, equipped with an antenna to pick up the beacon, took to the air shortly afterwards.\n\nSatoru Nakazawa, Hayabusa-2 sub-manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), who was part of the operation at Woomera, described the search: \"We went there with the helicopter and it was emitting the beacon signal. But at that time, it was still dark, so it was unclear [where it was]. I was very, very nervous.\n\n\"We flew over the area [where it landed] many times and I thought maybe that was where it was. Then the Sun rose and we could visually confirm the existence of the capsule. We thought: 'Wow, we found it!\"\n\n\"But we had a very jittery, frustrating time until sunrise.\"\n\nThe capsule was then taken to a \"quick-look facility\" for inspection. On Monday, Jaxa said it had collected gases from inside the container for analysis, adding that it was still not known whether they come from the Ryugu sample.\n\nAfterwards, the capsule will be airlifted to Japan, where it will be transported to a curation chamber at Jaxa in Sagamihara for analysis and storage.\n\nThe mission planned to collect a sample of more than 100mg from the asteroid Ryugu.Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, from Queen's University Belfast, said the sample would \"reveal a huge amount, not only about the history of the Solar System, but about these particular objects as well\".\n\nAsteroids are essentially leftover building materials from the formation of the Solar System. They're made of the same stuff that went into forming the Earth, but they avoided being incorporated into planets.\n\n\"Having samples from an asteroid like Ryugu will be really exciting for our field. We think Ryugu is made up of super-ancient rocks that will tell us how the Solar System formed,\" Prof Sara Russell, leader of the planetary materials group at London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News.\n\nStudying the samples from Ryugu could tell us how water and the ingredients for life were delivered to the early Earth.\n\nIt had long been thought that comets delivered much of the Earth's water in the early days of the Solar System. Alan Fitzsimmons said the chemical profile of water in comets was sometimes rather different from the profile of water in our planet's oceans.\n\nThe water composition of some asteroids in the outer Solar System, however, is a much closer match. Ryugu probably originated in this cold zone, before migrating inwards to its current orbit, closer to Earth.\n\n\"It may be that we've been looking to comets all this time for delivering water to Earth in the early Solar System. Perhaps we should have been looking a bit closer to home, at these primitive but rather rocky asteroids,\" Prof Fitzsimmons told BBC News.\n\n\"Indeed that's something that will be looked at very carefully in these Ryugu samples.\"\n\nResearchers from around Japan, and other countries, will be working with the samples. In the UK, Prof Russell's team at the Natural History Museum and scientists from the universities of Manchester and Glasgow will get to study the material.\n\nDr Sarah Crowther is one of several researchers at Manchester expecting to receive samples next year. She explained: \"Different labs contribute different expertise, which all helps in understanding the material collected.\"\n\nThe Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, which bypassed the Earth after releasing its capsule, is being sent on another mission. It will now travel to a much smaller, 30m-wide asteroid, reaching it in 2031.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",

    "content": "The ongoing battle between Fortnite's dueling communities has a new front: the in-game currency known as \"V-Bucks.\" \n\nWhile Fortnite might be more recognized for its PvP Battle Royale mode, it's actually just one mode of a single game alongside the original PvE mode known as 'Save the World.' As such, the two modes share a game client, as well an in-game currency called V-Bucks. While V-Bucks can be purchased for money, it can also be earned in PvE, leading some PvP players to use this shared economy to their advantage, farming PvE games to earn V-Bucks to spend again in PvP. And it's causing some problems. Like a lot of games these days, Fortnite features a loot system where players can grind and earn in-game currency to purchase various loot, or buy in-game currency using real money for faster access. There's no way to \"earn\" V-Bucks in Battle Royale. Instead Epic has a system utilizing season passes that Battle Royale players can purchase to earn exclusive content. But Battle Royale players can still just buy V-Bucks to purchase cosmetics from from the store too if they're strapped for time. \n\nThat's where the Save the World mode comes in. For PvE players, a small amount of V-Bucks are awarded on a semi-regular basis. Yet thanks to Fortnite's shared V-Bucks economy, Battle Royale players are choosing to grind out V-Bucks in Save the World to then spend elsewhere, which is creating further rifts in the already split community. \n\nSave the World players feel their preferred mode keeps getting flooded with fairweather players who have no vested interest in the wider mechanics of PvE. Instead, they are just using Save the World to scrape and save V-Bucks earned in daily logins or quests. Players who are away from their keyboards and players who can't commit to the rigors of co-op play are problematic because the game is heavily reliant on working together. \n\nThere are even guides, subreddit threads, and whole websites dedicated to teaching Battle Royale players how to earn free V-Bucks from farming the PvE Save the World mode, like freethevbucks.com. \n\nEven then it's not particularly easy to farm V-Bucks in Save the World. One user who messaged us says that, \"it's a pain to grind out V-Bucks in [Save the World]. You earn 100 or less V-Bucks per quest and only certain quests give out V-Bucks as a reward. I have made a little under 3K V-Bucks in about a month.\" Since skins in Battle Royale cost anywhere from about 800 to 2,000 V-Bucks (1,000 V-Bucks retails for $9.99) that's about one or two skins a month. For some Battle Royale players, it's apparently preferable to just spend $20 on V-Bucks than play a cooperative game mode. One thread in the Fortnite Battle Royale subreddit thread simply titled \"Don't buy Save the World just to farm [V-Bucks]\" warns some players to stay away. \"If you can't enjoy a cooperative game about building stuff and waking zombies, don't buy it... Just spend [$20] on V-Bucks.\" \n\nIf players treated the two modes as part of the same game and played both in earnest, this might not be a problem. But there's clearly a divide between the two modes and how the players treat the other game mode. As a result we get PvP players outright dismissing the PvE mode as just a source for V-Bucks. Even then, there are those with so little interest that they'd rather just spend real-money to purchase their desired skins than play Save the World. \n\nIn a message through Reddit, a Battle Royale player tells USgamer, \"I would say that for members of the community who play both modes, it's probably common to log on to [Save the World], do your daily quest for the V-Bucks, and then switch over to [Battle Royale].\" \n\n\"I'll admit that now a big part of my motivation for playing [Save the World] is earning those V-Bucks that I can use for cosmetics in PvP,\" another Redditor says when asked why they still play PvE. The farming aspects of the game add fuel to calls that the two modes should be separate games altogether, with separate game clients, and maybe even currencies. A thread, this time on the PvE Fortnite subreddit, calls for this exact thing in Battle Royale and Save the World in order to discourage farming and \"leeching\" behavior out of fear that the latter is just a farming ground for V-Bucks. But that doesn't seem likely as this shared V-Bucks economy most likely works in Epic's favor. \n\nBy having a way to farm V-Bucks in one mode but not the other, it's likely that Battle Royale players who get to play the PvP mode for free will be tempted to purchase a paid copy of the Save the World game, keeping both modes busy with daily logins and players, even if it's just to help one group of players purchase outfits and cosmetics. \n\nThe most optimistic outcome of the shared V-Bucks economy is getting the two camps of players to play the other mode regularly and properly, the likely ideal scenario here. And in-between the more extreme sides of the divide are players who mainly play Save the World, but choose to spend their V-Bucks in Battle Royale, or Battle Royale players that commit to Save the World matches in earnest. \n\nWe reached out to Epic Games to ask what the developer's plans are for V-Bucks once Save the World does go free-to-play, but the company declined to comment. What's clear though is that the schism between Battle Royale and Save the World players hasn't healed in recent months. The Fortnite Save the World and Battle Royale community have already split their subreddits, and some hardcore players are demanding that the game modes themselves be split from one another entirely. \n\nA lot of that stems from resentment that Save the World has been put on the backburner so that primary focus can shift to Battle Royale, a mode that launched for free whereas Save the World was sold under a complicated and potentially expensive early access buy-in. When Save the World does eventually become free-to-play, there is also the fear that the mode will be completely relegated as a V-Bucks farming ground for the much larger Battle Royale playerbase lest changes are made. \n\nSince Battle Royale and Save the World are actually just two modes for the same basic game, this relationship where one side benefits off the other feels potentially dangerous. Hopefully the V-Bucks system will eventually be balanced so that Fortnite players can share in an economy that helps both game modes grow, or it risks creating a system where one mode leeches off the other.",

The school is now making the software available during the fall term for optional use by instructors at the U of M.\n\n\"What is a little bit troublesome is there's a lack of clarity on where these things are being stored and who can access [them] outside of the institution itself,\" said Jelynn Dela Cruz, president of the University of Manitoba Students' Union.\n\nThe union has heard concerns about the software from students in recent days, she said, and is now in talks with university administration about the program, which locks down a student's screen, uses advanced algorithms for facial detection, motion, and data from the computer to identify patterns and anomalies associated with cheating. Dela Cruz said not every professor is using the software. Instead, some are choosing to use another program during exams that have all students in a class visible on webcam. \n\n\"Students have come to us voicing concerns about their classmates watching them during the exam, especially if they have accessibility needs that they're not necessarily comfortable sharing with the rest of the class.\"\n\nThe University of Manitoba has told faculty the program went through a rigorous evaluation before being approved.\n\n\"This software has undergone all the required considerations for privacy and security,\" U of M spokesperson Chris Rutkowski told CBC.\n\nHe said Respondus files are kept under secure means in the company's cloud, are not stored locally and are removed after the university's appeal period.He added that since students are watched by their peers in classes, it \"is also anticipated that students would prefer to focus on writing their exams and not be watching their classmates.\"\n\nBut U of M associate professor Neil McArthur, who is an ethicist, said he won't be using the software this fall.\n\n\"To have software that not only locks a student's computer but monitors their eye movements and their physical movements I think is a clear violation of privacy,\" he said.\n\nMcArthur said even if the U of M asks for students' consent before using the program, it's problematic in his view. \n\n\"The consent is complicated because what they're consenting to is in a sense coerced in that they need to compete for this in order to get to pass the course and write the exam.\"\n\nHe said instead of using the anti-cheating software, he will give students take-home exams they have 24 hours to complete.\n\n\"I try to give exam questions that are specifically tailored to the class material, so that you know, if they want to spend that 24 hours cramming desperately and reading all the class material if they haven't done that up till now, that's fine, because what they're doing basically is doing the course, which is what I want them to do.\" \n\nThe University of Regina said it is using anti-cheating software as a pilot with this summer's final exams.\n\nThe University of Winnipeg said a few departments are currently using live proctoring on Zoom while students are writing tests. it is investigating invigilation software and plans to run a pilot with it in a few courses this fall.\n\n\"Our faculty members are looking both at invigilation methods and a test construction that will inhibit opportunities to cheat, as well as alternative types of evaluation that don't involve a set test or exam,\" said U of W spokesperson Kevin Rosen.\n\nRed River College said it is not using anti-cheating software and instead is taking a proactive approach toward academic integrity. \"Our approach includes increased education and access to supports for students, anchored by an online learning module and class sessions to outline the risks and consequences to cheating,\" said college spokesperson Conor Lloyd in an email.\n\n\"By increasing the ways in which we evaluate students, we are able to provide more comprehensive assessments and take the weight off of a single exam. Our ultimate goal with this approach is to discourage cheating online and ensuring our students can access resources and supports early on to help them with their programs this fall.\"\n\nRespondus COO Jodi Feeney said its programs are designed with student privacy as a basic requirement.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the company had business relationships with the majority of Canadian universities, she said.\n\nThe company also said that just because students get a proctoring flag when they move away from their computers, it doesn't necessarily mean they'll get bad grades. \n\n\"For example, if the student goes to the door because someone is knocking on it, a flag is likely to appear in the proctoring results. However, when the instructor sees what happened in that segment of the video, the flag is likely to be ignored,\" company CEO David Smetters said in a statement.",

    "content": "Thousands of civilians remain displaced in northern Myanmar amid renewed fighting in recent weeks, many with little access to aid, bringing fresh concerns that the country’s peace process has stalled under the current government.\n\nFighting between the Myanmar army, known as the Tatmadaw, and the Kachin Independence Army, has seen local residents flee in at least three townships in Kachin State in recent weeks, local sources told VOA. Others have been pinned down by the fighting.\n\nMore than 150 people have been unable to leave an area of heavy fighting near Hpakant, a remote area renowned for the quality of its jade, local parliament representative Oo Choo told VOA by telephone.\n\n“They haven’t been able to leave for a week,” he said.\n\nHumanitarian aid\n\nDavid Baulk, a human rights specialist with Fortify Rights, said thousands have been displaced by fighting in the past month.\n\n“A lot of Kachin State is a war zone right now, and that’s what’s leading people to run for their lives,” Baulk told VOA. “The real issue when it comes to displacement in Tanai and other areas of Kachin State, is that the Myanmar government continues to systematically prevent aid groups from visiting these areas to provide basic services to people.”\n\nKnut Ostby, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Myanmar, released a statement last week condemning the latest violence in Kachin.\n\n“I appeal to all parties to the conflict to allow displaced people and other civilians who may remain in the areas of conflict to be permitted to move to a more secure location of their choice and to allow for humanitarian assistance to reach these populations as a matter of urgency,” he said in the statement.\n\nBut government spokesperson Zaw Htay denied the military was denying access to aid for civilians caught up in the conflict.\n\n“The government is already supporting humanitarian assistance for the Christians in the conflict,” he told VOA by telephone, before referring further questions to the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, who could not be reached for comment.\n\n​‘War crimes’\n\nOn April 23, a coalition of more than 30 Kachin civil society groups published a letter urging the United Nations Security Council to refer the Myanmar army to the International Criminal Court for its actions in the state.\n\n“Despite their obligations, the international community, including members of the United Nations Security Council, have failed in their duty to uphold international law,” said the statement, which claimed that Kachin people had been subjected to “numerous violations” of international law.\n\nThe statement also claimed that at least three Kachin civilians, as well as one Karen community leader, had been killed in recent weeks.\n\n“These are war crimes, but not one country has condemned these killings and promised to take action in response,” the statement said.​Peace process at a standstill\n\nSince the National League for Democracy came to power two years ago, there has been little progress on the peace process, an issue that State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi said she would make a priority.\n\nIn February, two relatively small ethnic armed groups agreed to join the government’s Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), but much of that progress has been offset by renewed fighting in Kayin State, home of the Karen National Union, perhaps the most influential of the two groups to have signed the NCA in October 2015.\n\nIt has been almost a year since the government last held its flagship event for the peace process, the 21st Century Panglong Union Peace Conference, the second such event held under the NLD. It has been rumored that the next event will take place in May, but that is yet to be confirmed.\n\n“Holding a successful [Union Peace Conference] will require overcoming several obstacles, particularly lack of trust among the different parties,” Richard Horsey, an independent analyst, told VOA. “Without a sense of shared commitment to a process and negotiated outcome, it will be hard to revitalize the peace process and convene the next conference.”\n\nHorsey said the peace process had “stagnated” and that there was frustration among signatories to the NCA, and skepticism among non-signatories towards signing the accord “until there are signs of greater political motivation and commitment to a negotiated political settlement.”\n\nNicola Williams, peace team leader at The Asia Foundation, agreed there had been a stalemate in political dialogue in recent years. She said that, while there had been much focus on the process of peace negotiations and cease-fire monitoring, there has been a “lack of emphasis and momentum on negotiations” to build policy solutions and the content of a peace accord.\n\n“Nonetheless, while the peace process can seem like it’s on life support, outside of the headlines, outside of the political statements and stalemates, ethnic armed groups and conflict parties are making quite diligent efforts to discuss a lot of the core peace process issues, and to develop draft principles in preparation for the UPC,” she told VOA.",

    "content": "An historic assault is being waged on the Amazon rainforest and the indigenous people who have called it home for thousands of years as the world’s population takes shelter from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDeforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose more than 50% in the first three months of 2020 compared to the same three-month period last year, according to preliminary satellite data released by the Brazilian Space Agency’s deforestation monitoring system.Even before the pandemic struck, scientists warned that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s development-friendly policies could transform the world’s largest rainforest into a drier, savannah-like landscape. Once this “tipping point” is crossed, scientists said, the ecosystem could begin emitting more greenhouse gases than it captures, effectively turning a vital tool in the fight against climate change into another source of harmful emissions.\n\nBrazil’s indigenous reserves hold some of the most pristine sections of the rainforest in the world and have long been targeted by illegal logging and mining operations seeking to exploit their natural resources. Since the outbreak started, however, Brazil’s environmental agency has scaled back more enforcement measures, leaving the forest and its indigenous tribes even more vulnerable to a litany of deadly threats.\n\n“Our territory keeps being invaded by loggers and hunters,” Laercio Guajajara, a member of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao, told ABC News. Even in the midst of the global health crisis, he said, there were “still a lot of invasions.”Now, those so-called invaders could leave more than just environmental destruction in their wake.\n\n“We are desperate,” Andre Karipuna, a 27-year-old member of the tiny Karipuna tribe of in the state of Rondonia, told the Environmental Justice Foundation. “The Karipuna are a small isolated community and just one infected person could rapidly pass the virus on to the whole tribe.”\n\nBrazil’s indigenous tribe’s have already been under increased pressure since Bolsonaro took office in 2019. He immediately began slashing funding and enforcement at FUNAI, the country’s department of indigenous affairs that provides essential services to indigenous communities across the nation. In July 2019, he appointed a federal police officer with connections to agribusiness to head the agency.\n\nSome tribal leaders have taken defense of their lands into their own hands. Last summer, ABC News was granted rare access to one such group, the Guajajara tribe’s “Guardians,” embedding within their ragtag convoy of trucks and motorcycles during a four-day patrol over several dozen miles of dense terrain.\n\nWith cameras rolling, the “Guardians” pursued an illegal logging operation deep into the jungle, employing satellite imagery, intelligence gathering and old-fashioned tracking along the way. The resulting documentary, “Guardians of the Amazon” captured a complex struggle, featuring powerful industrial interests, complicit tribal villagers, indifferent government agencies — and an ever-present fear of violent reprisals.Now, in the midst of the pandemic, the Brazilian government is again advancing controversial legislation regarding indigenous lands, potentially compounding tribes' vulnerability to invasion and infection.\n\nIn April, Bolsonaro's indigenous affairs agency, FUNAI, passed the controversial law IN 09. The new rule prevents long-held indigenous lands waiting for official demarcation from being labelled as \"indigenous\" in the land registry as they wait.\n\nEnvironmental groups allege the new law provides a route for those who illegally occupy indigenous lands to claim the land is not indigenous. According to Greenpeace, the seemingly obscure rule change will have drastic consequences for the nearly one third of indigenous lands still awaiting official designation by the government.\n\nAnother controversial rule, Provisional Measure (MP) 910, first decreed by Bolsonaro in December 2019, is now being considered for permanent law. The measure allows those who illegally deforested and occupied protected federal lands before December 2018 to purchase the property at reduced prices.\n\nCritics allege the rule is a reward for illegal land grabbers and criminal gangs who seized protected lands from indigenous tribes, and an analysis by the not-for-profit organization IMAZON found the measure could lead to the added deforestation of up to 16,000 square kilometers of rainforest by 2027.The Bolsonaro administration denies the new land ownership rules would facilitate and legitimize land-grabbing, arguing new landowners will be required to preserve up to 80% of their land and will only grant legal titles to those who occupied federal lands in a “tame and peaceful way for many years.” The measure could be passed by a virtual vote within a few weeks, without being subject to standard scrutiny, according to environmental groups.\n\nSince the enforcement rollbacks, reports of illegal logging and violent attacks across the region’s indigenous reserves have increased. Grave concern is widespread among indigenous tribes both large and small.\n\nIn early April, Indigenous leaders from the Yanomami reserve, the country’s largest, began reporting an increase in illegal gold mining during the pandemic. BBC Brasil published satellite photographs showing illegal miners moving into an area of the reserve where one isolated community lives. Some leaders reportedly blamed the invasions for the April 10th death of a 15-year-old boy who was the first among Yanomami known to die from the virus.\n\nThe Karipuna indigenous tribe of Rondonia -- one of the smallest and most vulnerable indigenous tribes in the country with less than 100 people – submitted a complaint to federal prosecutors on April 8th stating non-indigenous people were clearing inside their reserve.\n\n\"It is urgent that the authorities take surgical and structural measures to combat land grabbing underway [at the reserve]\" the complaint reads, demanding the identification, arrest, and withdrawal of the invaders.Some tribes are reporting an increase in land-use related bloodshed during the pandemic. On April 18th, a 33-year-old indigenous leader of the Uru-eu-wau-wau reserve in Rondonia was reportedly assassinated. The leader had been known for his outspoken criticism of illegal logging.\n\nAnd in March, Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao was killed by a shotgun-wielding assailant that has yet to be found, according to Amazon Watch. A teacher and longtime supporter of the Guajajara’s “Guardians of the Forest,” Zezico was reportedly gunned down while riding his motorcycle, becoming the fifth Guajajara murdered in as many months.\n\n“Indigenous lands are living a very difficult time,” Erival Guajajara, a 29-year-old member of the Guajajara told ABC News. “We are afraid for our lives because of our vulnerability.”",

Our guest entries to these areas have been stopped due to the pandemic,” the Istanbul’s Governor’s office said in a statement.\n\nA limited number of worshippers were allowed into the building to ensure adequate social distancing measures were in place.Many joined the prayer from public spaces nearby and from the rooftops of nearby buildings. Security officials had earlier closed off streets leading into the mosque area in order to better manage the expected worshippers.\n\nPaintings, depictions and mosaics were closed with a system of curtains during prayers.\n\nBefore the Friday prayers, Erdoğan recited from the Quran inside the reopened mosque, choosing from both the Surah Al-Fatihah and the Surah Al-Baqarah.\n\nThen Ali Erbaş, the head of Turkey’s Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), went up to the pulpit with a sword and read out the Friday sermon, or khutbah.\n\n“Hagia Sophia is the conquest’s symbol and the entrustment of its Conqueror who endowed it on condition that it remains a mosque until the last day,” Erbaş said in the khutbah with reference to the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II, who conquered Istanbul.\n\nLater, four muezzins from the mosque’s four minarets recited the adhan, or call to the prayer, and people started the Friday prayers.\n\nThe prayer started with Islamic rites, such as the takbir and salawat, which are invocations of God’s greatness and salutations upon the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nHundreds of people, including Erdoğan and his ministers, wearing white face masks as a precaution against COVID-19, knelt on blue carpets at the start of the Friday prayer at noon.\n\nIn the new era for Hagia Sophia, Diyanet will oversee religious services at the mosque, while the Culture and Tourism Ministry will supervise restoration and conservation work.\n\nThe architectural treasure will also be open to both domestic and foreign tourists free of charge.Leading the first Friday prayer performed in Hagia Sophia 86 years later, Ali Erbaş, the head of Turkey’s top religious authority, read the khutbah [sermon] with a sword in his hand on the pulpit.\n\nThe ritual of reading the khutbah with a sword, which is a tradition dating back to the Ottoman era, has different meanings depending on the way the sword is handled and where it is used.The sword held in the right hand reveals “its intention to use it” and aims to scare the enemy, according to the narratives.\n\nThe sword held in the left hand, like in the sermon, aims to give confidence to the allies.This tradition will continue in every Friday prayer in Hagia Sophia, said Erbaş.\n\nMosaics, paintings covered with curtains\n\nThe floor of the historical structure is covered with carpet, in protection of the historical texture and architecture of the building.\n\nThe omphalion (navel), the holiest part of the site for Orthodox Christians, will be hidden with a prayer carpet.Paintings and mosaics depicting Christian figures in the ancient building also will be covered with curtains during Muslim prayers.\n\nCurtains will be opened for those who want to see the icons by visiting the historical building outside of prayer times.",

We are concerned she may be in that trailer.\n\n\"We are asking the British police to help investigate so that my sister can be returned to the family.\"The last message received from Ms Tra My was at 22:30 BST on Tuesday - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium.\n\nHer family have shared texts she sent to her parents which translated read: \"I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed.\n\n\"I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother.\"\n\nMs Tra My's brother told the BBC her journey to the UK had begun on 3 October. She had told the family not to contact her because \"the organisers\" did not allow her to receive calls.\n\n\"She flew to China and stayed there for a couple days, then left for France,\" he said.\n\n\"She called us when she reached each destination. The first attempt she made to cross the border to the UK was 19 October, but she got caught and turned back. I don't know for sure from which port.\"\n\nThe BBC has passed details of Ms Tra My, who is from Nghen town in Can Loc district of Ha Tinh province area of Vietnam, to Essex Police, along with details of other people claiming to have information.\n\nThe BBC also knows of two other Vietnamese nationals who are missing - a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman.\n\nThe brother of the 19-year-old said his sister called him at 07:20 Belgian local time (06:20 BST) on Tuesday, saying she was getting into a container and was turning off her phone to avoid detection.\n\nHe has not heard from her since.\n\nHe said a people smuggler returned money to the family overnight, and the family of the 26-year-old who she was travelling with also received money back.\n\nA spokesman from the Vietnamese Embassy in London confirmed they had been in contact with Essex police since Thursday.\n\nThey said Vietnamese families had appealed to them for help finding out if their relatives were among the victims but added they had not yet received any official confirmation.The victims of the trailer were 31 men and eight women and Essex Police initially said they were all believed to be Chinese.\n\nThey were found at an industrial estate in Grays at 01:40 BST on Wednesday.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday evening Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said the force was working with the National Crime Agency, the Home Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Border Force and Immigration Enforcement.\n\nShe said she would not be drawn on any further detail about the nationalities of the victims until formal identification processes had taken place.\n\n\"We gave an initial steer on Thursday on nationality, however, this is now a developing picture,\" she said.Police have confirmed the scene at Waterglade Industrial Estate in Eastern Avenue was closed on Friday.\n\nEssex Police also urged anyone fearing their loved ones may have been in the lorry to get in touch.\n\n\"I can't begin to comprehend what some of you must be going through right now. You have my assurance that Essex Police will be working tirelessly to understand the whole picture to this absolute tragedy,\" said Det Ch Con Mills.\n\nShe also urged anyone living illegally in the UK who may have information to come forward, without fear of criminal action being taken against them.\n\nGPS data shows the refrigerated container trailer crossed back and forth between the UK and Europe in the days before it was found.\n\nIt was leased from the company Global Trailer Rentals on 15 October. The company said it was \"entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been\".\n\nEssex Police said the tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) had entered the UK via Holyhead - an Irish Sea port in Wales - on Sunday 20 October, having travelled over from Dublin.Police believe the tractor unit collected the trailer in Purfleet on the River Thames and left the port shortly after 01:05 on Thursday. Police were called to the industrial park where the bodies were discovered about half an hour later.\n\nTemperatures in refrigerated units can be as low as -25C (-13F). The lorry now is at a secure site in Essex.\n\nA spokesman for the UN International Organization for Migration said the discovery of bodies in Essex did not necessarily indicate a major shift in migration patterns.\n\n\"These are the kind of random crimes that occur every day in the world somewhere,\" he said. \"They get huge attention when they do but they don't necessarily indicate a big shift in migration or patterns in any place in particular. It's just the condition of what happens when this many people are engaging this many criminal groups to reach a destination, which of course we deplore.\"\n\nDetectives are still questioning the lorry driver, Mo Robinson, of County Armagh in Northern Ireland, on suspicion of murder. He was arrested on Wednesday.\n\nTwo other people were also earlier arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.\n\nThe man and woman, both 38, from Warrington, Cheshire, are also being held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nPolice officers were seen at the couple's home address in Warrington, with a police van and two squad cars parked outside.\n1. Sources say the GPS data shows it left Monaghan in the Republic of Irelandon 15 October before crossing over to Northern Ireland and then returningsouth to Dublin\n2. From Dublin, it crossed over to Holyhead in Wales overnight on 16 October\n3. That evening, it travelled to continental Europe from Dover to Calais inFrance\n4.

    "content": "More than 100 wildfires have spread in various regions across the country over the past 24 hours including the areas of Chouf, Akkar, and Keserwan. The fires are strictly related to unusual high October temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (85 degrees Fahrenheit). This is not the first time the country faces a similar situation. However, wildfires usually break out in Lebanon in the summer and not in October, such as the large fire which spread out in the northern region of Akkar in August 2018. Observations reveal that these incidents are and will keep on increasing in frequency and in intensity due to climate change. Increased temperatures coupled with longer dry spells amplifies the susceptibility of lands to catch fires.\n\nThe most intense wildfires have been spreading in the Chouf area since the early hours of Monday the 14th of October. This Lebanese region has a rich natural heritage and, according to the Chouf cedar organization, it is home to the most significant cluster of Cedar trees in the county and in the middle east. The Mechref fire is seen as a serious threat due to its proximity to the residential area, schools, and the industrial area of Nehme.\n\nAs a consequence to this destructive event, the country is losing important natural assets. Electricity has been cut off in various regions. Residents of the area are fleeing their homes and seeking refuge elsewhere. People are also dealing with serious economic losses as a result of damages to their cars, homes or agricultural lands. Furthermore, the situation could have further health implications for people living in surrounding areas due to the trauma and the emissions of toxins in the air. Some people are more vulnerable than others including people with chronic diseases, kids and elderlies. In certain cases, wildfires could also lead to casualties. Unfortunately, that was the case of Salim Abou Mjahed who died as a result of inhaling smoke while trying to put out the fire. Moreover, the less fortunate are more susceptible as the situation could worsen their status. The fires are also likely to lead to the contamination of soil and water bodies and the reduction of soil fertility.\n\nThese wildfires events proved that Lebanon is not resilient to natural hazards and has a poor approach to disaster risk management. First, no proactive measures are implemented to avoid or lessen the impacts of natural disasters on the country including wildfires. Second, the reactive measures taken to extinguish the fires and contain the losses are not sufficient or efficient. Inhabitants of the region are joining efforts with emergency services to try to extinguish the fire. Additionally, according to the Cyprus Mail, the neighboring island is sending aircraft to Lebanon to help combat the fires.These wildfires should be a wake-up call to the importance of environmental management and developing emergency plans to deal with similar incidents. Addressing climate issues and ensuring a sustainable development of the country is not a luxury and should be considered a priority as natural disasters have serious social, economic and environmental consequences. Developing plans to increase the resilience of the country should not be seen as an economic burden since it opens a new market and ensures new job opportunities.\n\nMoreover, studies have shown that the cost of developing proactive measures and investing in the protection of the natural environment is less than the cost of dealing with the consequences of environmental disasters. The fact that some events are unpredictable or unavoidable shouldn’t delay or impede the implementation measures increasing the resilience of territory to natural disasters.\n\nThe country needs to develop impacts and risk assessments, implicate actors, and adopt correspondent strategies and laws to address the issue. For example, in accordance with the law of 13/08/2007 on the prevention of risks, French municipalities are required to develop municipal protection plans as a proactive tool to manage the risk in case of natural or technological disaster. This plan includes a diagnosis of local vulnerabilities and risks, the management of the support and protection of the population, an operational directory and the use of alert systems. Consequently, French municipalities have structured themselves to mobilize agents (system on-call and intervention procedures), materials, equipment, and technical means to assist the victims (blankets, beds, the opening of gymnasiums or relocation procedures.) The French case could be one approach to the development of an appropriate risk management plan in Lebanon.",

    "content": "Two teenagers were among the eight victims who died after a crowd surge Friday night during rapper Travis Scott's sold-out Astroworld music festival in Houston, officials said.\n\nThe identities of the eight people have not yet been released, but Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Saturday that one of the victims was 14, one was 16, two were 21, two were 23, one was 27 and one person's age has not been determined. Only six of the families have been notified.\n\nOf the 25 people who were taken to hospitals, 13 remained hospitalized Saturday, and five of the injured are under 18, Turner said. A 10-year-old among the injured is in critical condition.\n\nMore than 300 people were also treated throughout the event Friday at an on-site field hospital, officials said.The chaotic scene unfolded around 9:15 p.m. local time (10:15 p.m. ET) when \"the crowd began to compress toward the front of the stage,\" Fire Chief Samuel Peña said at a news conference early Saturday.\n\n\"That caused some panic, and it started causing some injuries. People began to fall out, become unconscious, and it created additional panic,\" he said, adding that a cause of death was not yet known for the eight victims but would be determined.\n\nAround 50,000 people were at the festival at NRG Park, which was hosted by Scott.\n\nOfficials said Saturday that 528 Houston Police Department officers provided security at the event and an additional 755 private security officers were provided by the entertainment company Live Nation.\n\nScott said he was \"absolutely devastated\" about what happened.\n\n\"My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival,\" he said in a tweet on Saturday. \"Houston PD has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss of life.”\n\n“I am committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need,\" he added.\n\nThe festival, which is in its third year, kicked off Friday and was expected to be a two-day event, but officials said Saturday's lineup had been canceled.\n\nAn NRG Park spokesperson said they were \"deeply saddened by the heartbreaking loss of life and pain experienced by all those impacted by this tragedy.\"\n\n\"We are fully cooperating and working closely with police and local authorities as they investigate how this tragedy occurred at the Astroworld Festival,\" the spokesperson said.One 16-year-old festivalgoer, who did not want to be identified, said the crowd began to push back and forth during a countdown around 8:30 p.m\n\n\"I couldn't even stand or breathe or anything, and I’m 6 feet tall and I was having to look up to the sky just to breathe before the show even started,\" he said. \"As the countdown was going to zero, it didn't make it through one full song before people just started collapsing and falling back.\"\n\nThe teen, who was at the show with his brothers, said roughly 30 people were \"dogpiled\" on each other and screaming for help.\"\n\n\"People at the bottom were definitely suffocating,\" he said.\n\nThe teen said he was in the pile for about 15 minutes.\n\n\"I got bruises on me, my thumb is still numb,\" he said. \"I thought I was going to die. It was literally like survival of the fittest. There was no escape. I’ve never seen grown men fighting for their life like that.\"\n\nHe was able to slip out of the pile and get to safety. He said he saw two or three bodies on the ground and heard others screaming, 'Help. I don’t want to die.'\"\n\nAlleighya Odom, 21, was also at the concert and said that the tightly packed crowd \"was like this force on my back, this continuous force.\"\n\n\"It was scary, like, genuinely,\" Odom said.\n\n\"I started looking around, and there's people on the ground. There's people looking at me, like, scared, eyes wild, like, 'Please help me,'\" she continued. \"There's people behind me crying because they're being stepped on.\"",

Devotees believe that by bathing in the Ganges one is freed from sins liberating her/him from the cycle of birth and death. Millions of people reach the place without any invitation. The congregation includes ascetics, saints, sadhus, aspirants-kalpavasis and visitors. The festival is held at Allahabad, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik every four years by rotation and is attended by millions of people irrespective of caste, creed or gender. Its primary bearers, however, belong to akhadas and ashrams, religious organizations, or are individuals living on alms. Kumbh Mela plays a central spiritual role in the country, exerting a mesmeric influence on ordinary Indians. The event encapsulates the science of astronomy, astrology, spirituality, ritualistic traditions, and social and cultural customs and practices, making it extremely rich in knowledge. As it is held in four different cities in India, it involves different social and cultural activities, making this a culturally diverse festival. Knowledge and skills related to the tradition are transmitted through ancient religious manuscripts, oral traditions, historical travelogues and texts produced by eminent historians. However, the teacher-student relationship of the sadhus in the ashrams and akhadas remains the most important method of imparting and safeguarding knowledge and skills relating to Kumbh Mela.",

    "content": "Malaysia has arrested more than 4,000 people for violating virus lockdown orders, marking the toughest law enforcement action in Southeast Asia after the Philippines, where the president encourages police to shoot offenders.\n\nMalaysia is entering what it calls a “harsh mode” or a harsher phase of its official Movement Control Order to keep citizens in isolation and curb the spread of coronavirus, which threatens both the economy and human rights.\n\nPolice set up hundreds of roadblocks, have been conducting inspections, and have arrested thousands, including one man who jumped into the Strait of Malacca to avoid arrest, according to the government news service Bernama.\n\n“At first, the police enforcement was done in the soft and advisory mode, then it changed into the stern mode, and now it has entered the harsh mode,” Bernama quoted Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, the senior minister for security, as saying at a press conference Thursday. “So I hope the people will adhere to the MCO.”\n\nLockdown enforcement around the world has ranged from Florida charging a pastor who violated orders against mass gatherings, to Australia fining citizens who gather in groups of two or more.\n\nBut Malaysia reports one of the highest arrest rates, with 4,189 people arrested for loitering since March 18, including 1,449 charged in court. The rate is higher in the Philippines, where police arrested more than 20,000 lockdown violators, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said to “shoot them dead” if needed.\n\nMalaysia said its lockdown is decreasing the spread of COVID-19. It has reported 3,116 total cases and 50 deaths as of Friday.\n\nGoogle published data showing how much mobility has changed in each nation amid lockdown, using cell phone data. Malaysia saw the presence of citizens at retail and recreation sites decrease by 81% on Sunday, compared with about a month earlier, according to Google.\n\nThe law enforcement actions have included a crackdown on speech, however, that activists worry could threaten human rights, as the former ruling party that ran Malaysia for all except two years of its modern history returns to power.In addition to lockdown violators, the authorities have arrested people for allegedly spreading misinformation online about the virus. Journalists say they are self-censoring news about the virus to avoid punishment from the government.\n\n“Human rights workers, free expression advocates, bloggers, software developers, and activists are all in danger when government uses leeway obtained during a crisis to curtail free expression far beyond what’s required,” said Jason Kelley, a digital strategist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for an open internet.\n\nHe noted in a blog post that Malaysia is among several governments arresting people for alleged misinformation, and he says many of those arrested are activists.\n\nEconomists say the political turmoil in Kuala Lumpur will make it hard for the government to fight the coronavirus. Mahathir Mohamad, who became prime minister again in 2018 thanks mostly to the 1MDB corruption scandal that sank the prior regime, tried to consolidate power in February. His failure caused a political crisis until the old ruling party stepped into the power vacuum in March.\n\nWith the old party back in power, the government has started to stabilize, but the virus is still threatening the economy. Malaysia is one of the first three economies in the region, in addition to Singapore and Thailand, to predict a recession this year because of the coronavirus.\n\nIn response, the government announced last week the “People's Economic Stimulus Package,” locally abbreviated as PRIHATIN, to deal with COVID-19. The package includes $57.3 billion worth of cash aid, loans, deferred taxes and debt payments, along with other aid.\n\n“The sheer size of PRIHATIN signals the seriousness and sincerity in the government's approach,” said Jason Liang and Krystal Ng, partners at law firm Wong & Partners, in a joint assessment. “These measures ought to be far-reaching and should provide a source of encouragement and relief.”",

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (KPIX) – With coronavirus infections once again on the rise, contact tracing is ever more critical to control the spread of the virus. A growing number of new apps are designed to help do that.\nSome are privately developed, others are developed by governments. Here in the U.S, only four states are using them as part of their pandemic strategy. But in other countries they’re getting popular.\n\nBrett Hall just started using a contact tracing app for COVID-19 called Corona-Warn, developed by the German Government.\n\n“I heard about it and downloaded it pretty quickly, actually, on the day that it was released officially,” said Hall.\n\nHall’s been living in Berlin for the past decade. He says downloading the app was voluntary.\n\n“The more people have it the more effective it is, so I felt it was something that I should do to help get back to a sense of normality quicker,” said Hall.\n\nHere’s the way the app Hall is using and most others like it work: On your way through the day from home to work or exercise or shopping, it documents the digital encounter between two smartphones. If someone using the app tests positive for the coronavirus, they can notify others if they chose to. If you had contact with that person, the app will quickly inform you.\n\n“Any contact is then held anonymous. So your details are held anonymously on your phone and you only receive information,” said Hall.\n\nCorona-Warn does not allow you to know who it is that was infected or where you met them. Vice-versa, the infected person can’t tell who was informed. Most contact tracing apps are designed that way. But that doesn’t guarantee you privacy protection.\n\n“There certainly are some privacy concerns,” said Quentin Palfrey.\n\nPalfrey heads up the newly formed International Digital Accountability Council (IDAC) that analyzed privacy protocols on 108 COVID-19 related apps in 41 countries, 23 of them used specifically for contact tracing.\n\n“In some instances the apps didn’t even have a privacy policy that is actually required by the Google Play store terms. There were other instances where there was a privacy policy, but it was clearly inadequate,” said Palfrey.\n\nOne problem the research highlights: Something called a permission.\n\n“When you download an app, sometimes you get a request, you know, is it okay if we look at your contacts? Is it ok if we read some of the data that’s on your phone? And that can be a gateway to passing information along to third parties,” said Palfrey.\n\nFor instance the Healthy Together contact tracing app, used by the state of Utah, asked for permission to read location and contacts. Other apps they reviewed asked only for location.\n\n“The data you give to an app should relate to what you’re getting out of the app,” said Palfrey.\n\nHealthy Together currently has 52,500 active users according to a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Health.\n\nResearchers also found connections with third party marketers were not always clearly spelled out. For example North Dakota’s app called CARE 19 was at first called out for its relationship with Foursquare, a marketing company.\n\nIt now discloses that it uses Foursquare “to determine nearby businesses that you may have visited.”\n\nThe app’s developer told KPIX 5 that Foursquare has agreed not to retain data. The app currently has 35,000 active users.\n\nBut Matthew Guariglia, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told said privacy agreements are not a guarantee, and any kind of third party arrangement might make users apprehensive.\n\n“If you think that the app that’s supposed to keep you safe from a virus is going to sell you shoes the next day from a shoe store you walked by, you’re not going to want to use it,” said Guariglia.\n\nHe adds says there’s also a security risk.\n\n“Whenever you have a company or entity that is storing a vast amount of sensitive information, that data, that storage, is going to have a huge target on it,” said Guariglia.\n\nResearchers with the Digital Accountability Council found some apps, including the one developed by Centers for Disease Control, also sent transmissions that were not encrypted.\n\n“We thought that created a cybersecurity risk, that might undermine the public’s trust in the CDC,” said Palfrey.\n\nIn general though, the researchers found the apps do a lot to protect the privacy of users. The most secure apps reviewed were Private Kit and Pathcheck GPS.\n\nKPIX 5 asked the IDAC to review Hall’s app, Corona-Warn, for this story. Their verdict without having tested it was a preliminary thumbs up.\n\nBack in Berlin, Brett Hall is, so far, happy with it too.\n\n“If it’s for something as serious as this then I am willing to accept it,” said Hall.\n\nCalifornia is currently not using a contact tracing app. A spokesperson for the Department of Health told us most of that work can be done by phone, text, email and chat.\n\n\n \nStatement from the developer of North Dakota’s CARE-19 contact tracing app, Tim Brookins:\nCare19 Diary is an app that helps users remember where they have been over the last 14 days, to aide in contact tracing. The phone gives us numerical coordinates (latitude\\longitude) but that isn’t helpful to people. Se we take that coordinate and send it to a “reverse geo-location service”. The service takes the coordinate and matches it in a database of around 100 million businesses. It then returns the closest business, so the user can remember they went to “Wal-Mart” rather than 46.433434, -96.340349\n\nThere are many firms that provide reverse geo-location: Apple, Google, Microsoft\\Bing, Here and Foursquare to name a few. We use Foursquare. Jumbo Privacy saw us transmit to Foursquare and jumped to the conclusion that we were “sharing” data with Foursquare. In actuality we had a legal agreement with Foursquare that they would simply return the closest business and not retain any data beyond that. Foursquare officially confirmed this the next day after the Jumbo Privacy report, but now media just keeps recycling the (incorrect) story.\n\nLink:\nOfficial ND\\Foursquare statement\n\nGermany’s Corona-warn app is based on an exposure notification technology developed by and google. Neither company would give us a list of governments using their technology, but Google sent us these testimonials from North dakota and Alabama”\n\nStatement from Governor Doug Burgum, North Dakota:\n\nNorth Dakota is excited to be among the first states in the nation to utilize the exposure notification technology built by Apple and Google to help keep our citizens safe. The CARE19 Exposure app will help us improve contact tracing and continue our ND Smart Restart by notifying people who may have been exposed to COVID-19, reaching the greatest number of people in a way that protects their privacy. As we respond to this unprecedented public health emergency, we invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running.\n\nStatement from Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama State Health Officer:\n\nThe State of Alabama’s priority as we fight the COVID-19 pandemic together is the health and safety of its citizens as well as their privacy. In partnership with Apple and Google, the Alabama Department of Public Health, University of Alabama System, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, we are harnessing technology to accelerate exposure notification to slow the spread of COVID-19 so that we can all be safe together.\n\nStatement from Apple:\nWe leave it to public health agencies to announce their own plans. You may have seen a number of recent announcements about the launches of apps in a number of U.S. states and countries including Latvia, Germany, Poland, Italy, Uruguay, and Denmark.\n\nAlso Google and Apple have prioritized user privacy and security in the development of our exposure notification technology, as embodied in the following protections:\n\nUsers must explicitly choose to turn on exposure notifications — and can turn it off at any time\nThe system doesn’t collect or use device location, including for users who report positive\nUsers decide whether they want to report a positive diagnosis\nUser identities are not known to other users, Google, or Apple\nMatching for exposure notifications is only done on device, under the user’s control\nThe system is only used for exposure notifications by official public health authorities, and isn’t monetized\nGoogle and Apple will disable the exposure notifications system on a regional basis when it is no longer needed. Apps must be created by or for a government public health authority and they can only be used for COVID-19 response efforts.\nApps must require users to consent before the app can use the Exposure Notifications API.\nApps must require users to consent before sharing a positive test result, and the “keys” associated with their devices, with the public health authority.\nApps should only collect the minimum amount of data necessary and can only use that data for COVID-19 response efforts. All other uses of user data, including targeting advertising, is not permitted.\nApps are prohibited from seeking permission to access Location Services.\nUse of the API will be restricted to one app per country to promote high user adoption and avoid fragmentation. If a country has opted for a regional or state approach, the companies are prepared to support those authorities.",

    "content": "BROCKTON, Mass. -- It conjures memories of the sales slogan employed by Virginia Slims during that era.\n\n“You’ve come a long way, baby.”\n\nWith a stroke of President Richard Nixon’s pen, women’s college athletics forever changed on June 23, 1972.\n\n“I have two sons,” Bridgewater State University athletic director John Harper said, “and one of them (Jonathan, commissioner of the Little East Conference) has a daughter (10-year-old Skyler, twins with brother, Clayton) who’s playing in an instructional baseball league in Swansea. I can’t imagine what it would be like to be a girl and not have the opportunities that are out there now. But 30, 40 years ago, you didn’t know what you didn’t know.”\n\nSigned into law 40 years ago on Saturday, Title IX of the Education Amendment Act states that, “No person in the United State shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.’’\n\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education reported earlier this year that nearly 200,000 female athletes will compete on 9,274 NCAA teams in 2012. Compare that to the 31,852 female athletes who participated in 1972.\n\n“It really is amazing,” Stonehill College vice president for intercollegiate athletics Paula Sullivan said, “and I think without Title IX that would not have happened.\n\n“It certainly was the impetus behind promoting athletics for girls and women and it did a lot more, too, in all of education for women. It’s just not an athletic piece, but it’s true to form that these high school girls who participate in athletics usually are better students. It keeps them away from drugs and alcohol. It keeps them fit. There are less teenage pregnancies.\n\n“There are a lot of studies that show what sports do, never mind give (women) a skill set where they have a little more self-confidence. They’re able to work in a team environment that will benefit them later in life and (it helps with) time management and all of those good things.”\n\nWith a Hall of Fame playing career at Bridgewater State ending in 1971 and a women’s basketball coaching career at Stonehill that led to her induction into that college’s Hall of Fame beginning later that same year, Sullivan has lived athletic lives before and after Title IX.\n\nA Bridgewater State (Class of ’76) Hall of Famer herself, Bentley University Hall of Famer Barbara Stevens recalls the era when Title IX was implemented.\n\n“During that time, we understood what was happening,” said Stevens, a Women’s Basketball Hall of Famer and the winningest coach ever in Div. 2. “We understood that there was a fight, if you will, occurring, and that change did not come easily in a lot of situations. It's still, at times, a battle, but the change fortunately has occurred.\n\n“I think back to when I was in high school (at Marianhill in Southbridge and Marian High in Worcester), it was almost embarrassing sometimes to be known as a female athlete. Now, these kids thankfully embrace it. They’re confident. They’re proud to be known as good athletes.’’\n\n“I think back then it was just a different era. Yeah, if you loved to play that was great, but once you got off the court or the field or whatever it was, you had to face nicknames of ‘Tomboy’ or whatever that weren’t so flattering.”\n\nA member of Bridgewater State’s Class of 1955, South Weymouth resident Mary Lydon was pushing for a level playing field for males and females a generation before Title IX’s birth.\n\nLydon, the former director of physical education for the Quincy School Department who injured her knee (“they didn’t give us safety equipment”) while playing field hockey at Bridgewater State back in her day, calls the impact Title IX has had “mind boggling.\n\n“I never thought it would come this far. I really didn’t,” said Lydon, whose devotion to gender equity led to her presentation with The Heights Award at Boston College in 2006. “Now, schools are doing all they can for women. It’s a big difference.”\n\nIt’s certainly a big difference from the college life 93-year-old Quincy resident Mary Pratt knew when she was paying $432 a year to attend Boston University.\n\nA true pioneer in women’s sports, Pratt pitched in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League from 1943-1947. She also spent more than half her life teaching (most of it in Quincy) and coaching at the high school and collegiate levels (Salem State).\n\n“Once Title IX came along, there was a far different approach,” said Pratt, a lifelong advocate for the advancement of girls and women in sports whose efforts also resulted in her presentation with The Heights Award in 2006. “There are so many opportunities. Girls are getting a chance. Seeing them get scholarships and exposure on TV is wonderful. What more could I ask for?”",

    "content": "SANA, Yemen — Twelve-year-old Nefisa Nasser lined up four jerrycans by a faucet on the side of a busy street, patiently waiting her turn to fill them with water. She completed the daily routine, capping each container and sliding it into a wheelbarrow that she pushed back home through the clamor of morning traffic.\n\n“Sometimes she comes back crying,” said her father, Muhammed Nasser, as Nefisa sat nearby on a folded bedspread. “Of course it pains me,” he said, “but our circumstances are difficult.”\n\nDifficult is just how life is in Yemen, yesterday, today and every day. It does not matter that the president and his cabinet have resigned, that the government has not functioned for weeks or that the gunmen in control of the streets say they plan to set up a new regime to their own liking.\n\nFamilies have always had to struggle to get through their days in a country where the government has long been incapable of delivering essential services. There is hardly any running water now — and there was hardly any before the political crisis.\n\n“In this country, people are accustomed to managing their lives without the state,” said Abdullah Alrahabi, who dug a well years ago on his property to supplement the critically short supply from the official system. He also supplies water to neighboring schools and mosques, and provides the free faucet Nefisa uses every morning. “We don’t even rely on the state for the most basic services,” Mr. Alrahabi said.\n\nTake Mr. Nasser, for example. He spent one recent morning, as he does many mornings, negotiating to reduce the fines on traffic tickets issued for a minibus he owns and rents out. Then he borrowed $250 to put the vehicle back on the street. At home, his wife prepared lunch for their five children and a few visiting relatives, just as she almost always does, without running water or electricity.\n\nShe strapped a flashlight to her forehead and used the water her daughter brought to cook a dish made of dough and broth.\n\nTo be sure, Yemenis are now confronting a whole new level of political uncertainty. The Shiite Houthi militia from the north has taken over the capital and has announced plans to name a new national council and eventually a new president. Southern separatists are fighting to break the country back up into two independent states. The former longtime president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was driven from power by popular protests in 2012, appears to be using old loyalties to renew his sway.\n\nBut people here say everyday life is unchanged.\n\nMr. Alrahabi, a manager in the president’s foreign relations office, said he continued to go to work, as he has done for 20 years, knowing that he is performing a perfunctory role in a system with crippled institutions.\n\nEditors’ Picks\n\nWhat Does the End of Beef Mean for Our Sense of Self?\n\nHow the ‘Encanto’ Soundtrack Became a Smash\n\nAgain and Again, Literature Provides an Outlet for the Upended Lives of Refugees\n“Let’s just say we live in a quasi-state,” Mr. Alrahabi said plainly.\n\nThat sentiment echoed from door to door in the capital, exposing the deep social disarray at the heart of the current political crisis. Yemenis have withstood the momentary leadership vacuum not by relying on state institutions but by turning to geographic, religious and tribal safety nets that have never been fully united under a strong, shared national identity.The fissures in Yemen today are largely the legacy of Mr. Saleh, who ruled for decades and deliberately kept the formal state frail while emphasizing his personal hold on power, said experts and officials here.\n\n“His role is that of the devil,” said Hasan Zaid, a minister of state and a member of the cabinet of Mr. Saleh’s successor, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who resigned two weeks ago. “You keep discovering how weak state institutions are. The army and police are sizable, but they are closer to militias belonging to the former president and his family than to a national force.”\n\nFearing the growing strength of his government’s military and intelligence agencies, Mr. Saleh had created parallel security bodies and placed them in the hands of his son and nephew. After he was ousted in the wave of Arab Spring revolutions, Yemen’s various security forces polarized, serving the interests of competing power centers rather than the state and doing little for the security of ordinary Yemenis. And the provision of basic services, in a country facing increasing violence and persistent poverty, only worsened.\n\n“We should hide how we live,” said Moneef Almaqtari, 20, as he walked home in the popular Belaily neighborhood of Sana, not far from where Nefisa Nasser draws her water. Mr. Almaqtari ducked his head under the clotheslines strung outside his door, where a pair of washed disposable baby diapers were hung.\n\n“It is not a home, it’s a hut,” Mr. Almaqtari said as he walked to the kitchen, where his sister was making flat bread on a gas stove. He earns $200 a month as a supermarket cashier, he said, but his father and two of his brothers are construction day laborers, and they rarely get work these days. All their earnings are pooled to buy food. “This is the only life I ever knew,” he said, “but with every president, the crisis gets worse and we suffer more.”\n\nHow much influence Mr. Saleh still wields is unclear, but the legacy of his years in power and the fractured state he led is palpable in the attitudes of Yemenis on the street.\n\n“We never feel like the government is there, anyway,” said Taghreed Abdul Wahab, 21, a student at Sana University, who stood with a group of classmates preparing for a geography test.\n\nTheir exams were postponed after the latest spate of violence, but they complained more about persistent problems on campus like favoritism and corruption, which they said are never addressed. “Students with lower grades can be admitted to medicine over others because they’re from the right family or they know the right people,” Ms. Abdul Wahab said.\n\nBelal Hussein, 25, a graduate with a business degree who supervised an exam earlier in the day, overheard the conversation. Mr. Hussein introduced himself as a government employee who had not been paid his salary in seven months.\n\n“They keep saying they have no revenues,” he said.\n\nMr. Hussein’s job is to keep track of employee attendance at the Commission for Public Lands, a body that manages state property. He admitted that he accepted bribes to mark colleagues present who had missed work because they had second jobs.\n\n“How else am I supposed to live?” Mr. Hussein asked.\n\nYemenis refer offhandedly to the revolution set off in 2011, when the Arab Spring began, and its aftershocks as “the crisis.” The instability it brought allowed the Houthis to sweep into the capital, driving out the old leadership and promising reform. But many Yemenis have reason to be skeptical.\n\nBack in Al Belaily, Mr. Nasser waited for lunch to be served.\n\n“So far, the Houthis haven’t done much for us,” he said as his children gathered for the meal. He looked at the basic food spread on the floor. “On Fridays,” he said, a little embarrassed, “we also eat chicken.”",

Another 1 million were found to be highly vulnerable to dropping out of school.",

In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). All six cases occurred among women between the ages of 18 and 48, and symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered. Usually, an anticoagulant drug called heparin is used to treat blood clots. In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given.\n\nCDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance. FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases. Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution. This is important, in part, to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.\n\nRight now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare. COVID-19 vaccine safety is a top priority for the federal government, and we take all reports of health problems following COVID-19 vaccination very seriously. People who have received the J&J vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider. Health care providers are asked to report adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System at https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.\n\nCDC and FDA will provide additional information and answer questions later today at a media briefing. A recordingExternal Link Disclaimer of that media call is available on the FDA’s YouTube channel.\n\n\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

    "content": "Lunar Prospector was one of the NASA Discovery Program missions. It was designed to perform a low polar orbit investigation of the Moon. This included mapping the surface composition and locating lunar resources, measuring magnetic and gravity fields, and studying outgassing events. The data from this mission, which carried only scientific instruments, complemented the image data from the Clementine mission, which carried mostly cameras. The information gathered will improve the understanding of the origin, evolution, and current state of the Moon. The mission was launched January 6, 1998, from Cape Canaveral using a Lockheed Martin LMLV2 rocket.\n\nThe Primary Mission\nBeginning on January 15, 1998, Lunar Prospector spent one year mapping the entire surface of the Moon from a distance of about 100 kilometers (60 miles). The data collected during this phase of the mission greatly improved on the quality of data collected previously. Among the early returns from the instruments were those from the Neutron Spectrometer indicating significant amounts of water ice at the lunar poles.\n\nThe Extended Mission\nThe mission was extended for an additional seven months, starting in January 1999. At this time, the orbit of the spacecraft was lowered, first to about 30 kilometers (18 miles) and then to within about 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the lunar surface. This allowed the spacecraft to obtain data at much higher resolutions, greatly enhancing results, particularly those from the magnetic fields and gravity experiments.\n\nThe Impact Experiment\nOriginally, the mission was to have ended with the spacecraft crashing into the Moon when its fuel ran out. As the mission neared its end, however, the suggestion was made to use the crash as part of an experiment to confirm the existence of water on the Moon. The spacecraft was successfully directed into a crater near the lunar south pole, thought a likely location for ice deposits, but no water was detected in the resulting impact plume.\n\nLunar Prospector's Flight Path to the Moon   During the cruise phase, mid-course corrections were performed, the instrument booms deployed, and the instruments calibrated. On arrival at the Moon, the spacecraft went through three changes of orbit to place it into its nominal lunar polar orbit of about 118 minutes. With the correct orbit established, mapping data collection could begin.\n\nMore about the Spacecraft\n\nThe spacecraft was shaped like a drum and made of epoxy graphite material. It was approximately 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall and 1.4 meters (4.5 feet) in diameter. Total mass, when fully fueled, was about 295 kilograms (660 pounds). It was spin stabilized and maneuvering capability was provided by six thrusters. The power system consisted of body-mounted solar cells and storage batteries. There were three radial booms approximately 2.5 meters (8 feet) long for the instruments. These were located equidistantly around the perimeter of the spacecraft.\n\nThere was no onboard computer and only minimal onboard data storage capability. This was done primarily as a cost-cutting measure. Instead, the mission was controlled from the Earth and data from the experiments were downloaded continuously. A small solid-state memory was used to store data temporarily when the spacecraft made a pass over the lunar farside and was out of contact with Earth. An array of two transponders and two antennas was used for communications and data return.\n\nMission and Spacecraft Details at NSSDC\n\nMission Summary\n\nThe Lunar Prospector mission ran 19 months and successfully completed all of its objectives. The data collected will allow construction of a detailed map of the surface composition of the Moon. The data from this mission was 10 times better than hoped and is far more comprehensive than any data ever collected. The mission ended on July 31, 1999, when the spacecraft was directed to crash into a crater near the south pole as part of an experiment to confirm the existence of water ice on the Moon.",

    "content": "MOSCOW, June 8. /TASS/. Moscow’s authorities have decided to rescind self-isolation rules, travel permits and walking schedules starting on June 9, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote on his blog on Monday.\n\n\"Self-isolation rules and travel permits will be waived tomorrow, on June 9, 2020. There will also be no more walking schedules,\" he said.\n\nAll Moscow residents, including those over the age of 65 and people with chronic illnesses, will be able to freely travel around the city and visit public places.\n\nHairdressing salons, veterinary clinics and personnel recruitment agencies are to reopen. The same applies to the offices of non-governmental organizations and cemeteries. Restrictions will be lifted from car sharing services. Film and sound recording studios and research centers will resume normal operation. Theaters, concert halls and circuses will be able to conduct rehearsals.\n\nIn a week’s time, starting from June 16, dentist clinics, companies in the real estate segment, leasing, law, accounting, consulting, advertising and market research will get back to normal activity. It will be possible to hold sports competitions on the condition that the seat occupancy rate will be no greater than 10%.\n\nSummer cafes, libraries, museums, exhibition halls and zoos will be able to reopen provided they observe restrictions on the number of visitors at a time.\n\nDuring the third phase, starting on June 23, gyms, fitness clubs and swimming pools will be allowed to open alongside restaurants, cafes, canteens, bars, and other public catering outlets, spa salons, sunrooms, steam baths and saunas.\n\n\"All reopening organizations will be obliged to comply with the requirements of supervisory authorities and the consumer rights watchdog. The decision concerning the remaining restrictions will be taken later,\" the news release says.\n\n‘Self-protection’ rules\nMoscow residents will have to keep the ‘self-protection’ rules after the lifting of coronavirus-related restrictions, Sobyanin wrote on his blog on Monday, warning that the risk of being infected remains and the battle against the novel coronavirus has not ended in the city.\n\n\"Each of us still has to abide by the self-protection rules, and care for the people around us. Meanwhile the enterprises that have reopened must strictly abide by the requirements of the sanitary services,\" the mayor stressed.\n\nEarlier, Sobyanin specified that these rules implied compulsory facemasks and the social distancing of one-and-a-half meter.\n\nPossible changes\nDates for lifting the coronavirus lockdowns in Moscow may be subject to changes depending on the epidemiological situation in the city, as follows from the mayor’s decree released on Monday. \"Dates for lifting the restrictions may be changed depending on the current epidemiological situation,\" the document reads.\n\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia’s hardest hit area, Moscow, grew by 2,001 in the past 24 hours, to 197,018 people overall. The daily growth rate has been hovering at around 1% in the past week. As many as 1,633 patients recovered in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall number of recoveries to 104,347. Fifty-one patients died, which is the lowest figure in the past two weeks. Overall, 2,970 people have died in Moscow, or 1.51% of all cases.\n\nMoscow declared a high alert over the coronavirus on March 29. All residents were told to self-isolate, while numerous shops, eating establishments, parks, gyms and other facilities were closed. However, the city’s authorities have recently begun to ease restrictions as the coronavirus situation is improving. On May 12, construction businesses were allowed to reopen. The second phase of easing restrictions began on June 1, when some public services reopened and people were allowed out for walks based on a rotation system. However, wearing of protective masks and gloves in public remains mandatory.",

    "content": "Clashes broke out Sunday morning in three cities across Israel as police attempted to enforce coronavirus lockdown restrictions in a number of ultra-Orthodox communities.\n\nIn the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim, hundreds of people clashed with police attempting to shut down a yeshiva that had opened illegally.\n\nPolice said that officers who arrived at the yeshiva, or religious seminary, were quickly surrounded by a crowd shouting insults at them and throwing trash and other debris in their direction.\n\nVideo of the incident showed a number of people calling the officers “Nazis” and “kapos,” the name for Jewish collaborators coerced into service by the Third Reich.\n\nPolice said one person was arrested and water cannon trucks were later brought in to disperse the crowd.In the southern coastal city of Ashdod, police were confronted while closing down studies at an ultra-Orthodox elementary school that had opened despite Health Ministry and Education Ministry rules preventing in-person studies.Police said “several dozen people who arrived on the scene tried to force their way into the compound and confronted the officers inside.” Police added that the intruders injured four officers and caused damage to the fence surrounding the school.\n\nProtesters who had gathered outside also blocked traffic and confronted police officers, the statement said. Four people were arrested.In the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, several clashes reportedly broke out as police tried to shut down schools linked to the Vizhnitz Hasidic dynasty, whose head rabbi on Saturday ruled that educational institutions should open, before apparently backtracking hours later.\n\nPolice said in response to the violence that they would continue to enforce virus restrictions, “in all communities.”The lockdown, in its third week and extended till January 31, has shuttered all nonessential businesses along with the entire education system, excluding special education. Some ultra-Orthodox schools, however, have continued to operate in violation of the rules.Last week clashes broke out between police and rioters opposed to coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Bnei Brak after a mob in the city injured a police officer on patrol. At least six people were arrested for disturbing the peace. Those rioters belonged to an extremist faction of the Vizhnitz Hasidic sect, according to Hebrew media reports.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the Friday attack in Bnei Brak, stating that “we will act with a heavy hand against lawbreakers, first and foremost against those who raised their hands against our policewomen and policemen.”\n\nCritics have accused Netanyahu of avoiding cracking down on the Haredi public in order not to anger his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners.\n\nAdditional reports of lockdown violations among the ultra-Orthodox emerged Saturday, including a mass gathering over the weekend in the Sanz Hasidic sect in Netanya. Other sects are expected to hold prayers and gatherings this week.On Thursday, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein called for jailing those who broke lockdown rules.\n\nNetanyahu and Edelstein made appeals last week to Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, a leading ultra-Orthodox rabbi, asking that he influence the community to obey the lockdown. According to the Haaretz daily on Saturday, Kanievsky gave permission for some ultra-Orthodox schools to reopen this week, but only if it does not spark a confrontation with police. The report said some schools were hesitant to reopen despite his approval.Haredi communities have suffered disproportionately from the coronavirus, with infection rates in many ultra-Orthodox areas several times that of non-Haredi areas. High infection rates among Haredim are partly due to large family size and environmental factors, but experts also blame rule-breaking in large pockets of the community, often supported by rabbis and other community leaders.\n\nThe Health Ministry on Sunday reported a further decline in daily coronavirus infections the day before, as Israel’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began appeared to ease after weeks of strict lockdown rules and as the vaccination program continued to be rolled out.\n\nAccording to the ministry, 2,394 new cases were confirmed Saturday, after peaking at over 10,100 a week earlier. Sunday’s numbers are usually lower due to reduced testing at the weekend.\n\nThe total number of infections recorded in Israel reached 595,097, and the death toll stood at 4,361.\n\nThe ministry said there were 75,053 active cases, with 1,822 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Of those, 1,228 were in serious condition.",

    "content": "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket boosted a next-generation SpaceX cargo ship into orbit Sunday, the first in a new line of roomier, more capable Dragon capsules featuring many of the more advanced systems used by the company's Crew Dragon astronaut ferry ships.\n\nMaking the company's 21st supply run to the International Space Station — the first under a follow-on NASA contract — the new Cargo Dragon was loaded with more than 6,500 pounds of crew supplies, spare parts, science gear and other equipment, including a commercial airlock for on-board experiments.\n\nUnlike the original Dragon cargo ship, which had to be captured by the space station's robot arm for berthing, the Dragon 2 is designed to fly itself all the way to docking at the same ports used by piloted Crew Dragon spacecraft. Unlike the crewed version, however, the cargo ship is not equipped with seats or an emergency abort system. Running a day late because of bad weather, the long-awaited mission began at 11:17 a.m. EST when the Falcon 9's nine first stage Merlin 1D engines roared to life with a torrent of flame, pushing the 229-foot-tall rocket away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. It was the 24th Falcon 9 launch so far this year, the 101st since the rocket's debut in 2010, the 21st SpaceX ISS cargo launch and the first for a Dragon 2 capsule.\n\nAccelerating on 1.7 million pounds of thrust, the rocket quickly arced away to the northeast, climbing directly into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for spacecraft trying to catch up and dock with a target moving at nearly 5 miles per second.\n\nTwo-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, now well out of the thick lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fourth flight, fell away and flew itself to a landing on a downrange SpaceX droneship. It was SpaceX's 68th successful booster recovery and its 47th at sea.\n\nThe Falcon 9's second stage, meanwhile, continued the climb to space, releasing the Dragon 2 capsule into the planned preliminary orbit 12 minutes after launch. If all goes well, the capsule will rendezvous with the station Monday, guiding itself in for a docking at the upper port of the forward Harmony module around 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe space station is equipped with eight docking ports, four used by Russian spacecraft and four on the forward end of the lab that are available for U.S. cargo and crew ships. Two of the U.S. ports are used by visiting cargo ships that need the station's robot arm to pull them in for berthing.\n\nThe other two U.S. ports, however, are equipped with docking mechanisms that can accommodate automated linkups by SpaceX crew and cargo Dragons and Boeing's CST-100 Starlink crew ferry ship. The Crew Dragon spacecraft that carried four astronauts to the station last month is docked at Harmony's forward-most port while the Dragon 2 cargo ship will carry out the first docking at the module's upper space-facing port. SpaceX won NASA contacts valued at $3.04 billion for 20 space station resupply flights through 2020 using the original Dragon cargo ship design and contracts for an unspecified amount covering at least nine additional flights through 2024 using the Dragon 2 spacecraft. The capsule launched Sunday is the first of those.\n\nSpaceX also holds a $2.6 billion NASA contract to build and launch the piloted Crew Dragon capsule to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. So far, three Crew Dragons, two with astronaut crews and one without, have docked at the station.\n\nFor its maiden flight, the Dragon 2 cargo ship's pressurized cabin was loaded with 803 pounds of crew supplies; 2,100 pounds of science gear; 265 pounds of spacewalk equipment; 698 pounds of vehicle hardware; 102 pounds of computer equipment; and 53 pounds of Russian hardware.\n\nStored in the capsule's unpressurized trunk section was a 2,400-pound airlock developed by Nanoracks, a company that facilitates flights by private industry, university and government-sponsored experiments. The airlock will be attached to the Tranquility module's far left port and periodically detached, exposing experiments inside and mounted on its exterior to the vacuum of space.\n\nThe station already features a Japanese experiment airlock, but the Nanoracks unit, known as the Bishop Airlock, is about five times larger, said project manager Brock Howe.\n\n\"There are a lot of different environments that the scientists can use, a lot of different volumes, a lot of different payload power and data capabilities on board the airlock that really will enhance their ability to do some really cool science,\" he said.\n\nOther equipment on board the Dragon 2 includes parts for the lab's recently delivered female-friendly next generation toilet, gear for the station's water recycling system, a nitrogen tank for cabin repressurization and a rodent habitat with research specimens.\n\nAmong the experiments being delivered are two designed to study how microgravity affects heart and brain tissue and another called \"BioAsteroid\" that will probe the role microbes might play in future space mining operations.\n\n\"BioAsteroid is an experiment to study whether we can use micro organisms, bacteria or fungi, to extract economically interesting elements from asteroid material,\" said principal investigator Charles Cockell, professor of astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n\"It's essentially what we would call a bio-mining experiment, and we hope to learn whether we can use microbes to extract things like rare earth elements and other elements that can be used to sustain a self sustaining human presence throughout the solar system.\"",

Reports say that thick fog around Yirol, in the centre of the country, may have played a part in the accident. Only three of the plane’s passengers: two children and an Italian doctor, survived.\n\nOther victims include a member of the Red Cross in South Sudan. “When it arrived the weather was so foggy and when it tried to land it crashed into Lake Yirol adjacent to Yirol town”, regional government minister Abel Aguek was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying. “The whole town is in shock, the shops are closed, some people have taken their relatives for burial. It is a commercial plane that crashed.”\n\nLocal fishermen were first on the scene to rescue survivors and retrieve the bodies of those killed.“Mama Joyce and I are saddened to hear of the plane crash in Yirol this morning, which has claimed the lives of a number of people, including the ECSS Bishop of Yirol, Rt Revd Simon Adut Yuang,” the Primate of South Sudan, Archbishop Justin Badi Arama, said.\n\n“Bishop Simon was an energetic young man and is a loss to the Episcopal Church of South Sudan. Please join us in praying for the families and friends of all involved in the accident.\n\n“Jesus said, ‘I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die.’”\n\nBishop Simon had been Bishop of Yirol for a relatively short time. He succeeded Bishop Daniel Deng Abeil, who died in office in January 2015 as a result of cancer. Bishop Simon was elected in May that year and consecrated and enthroned that July. He leaves behind a wife and six children.",

    "content": "(CNN)If there's anything both sides of America's heated and polarizing gun debate may agree on, it's the need to keep firearms out of the hands of people with serious mental illness.\n\nThat is not the same as saying gun violence is a mental health issue, which has become a renewed area of contention since President Obama announced new actions earlier this month to reduce gun violence, including increased funding for mental health treatment and enhanced background checks.\nMental health advocates say media reports of mass shootings by disturbed individuals galvanize public attention and reinforce the impression that severe mental illness leads to violence. But various epidemiologic studies over the past two decades show that the vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are never violent toward others.\nPeople with serious mental illness are three times more likely than those who are not mentally ill to commit violent acts again themselves or others, but that is still a very small number of people, about 2.9% of people with serious mental illness within a year. And the impact on gun violence statistics is marginal, amounting to about 4% of all firearm homicides, according to research as recent as last year.\nWhen talking about gun deaths from suicide, however, epidemiologists say mental illness legitimately becomes an area of concern. Suicides accounted for 61% of all firearm fatalities in the United States in 2014, or 21,384 of 33,599 gun deaths recorded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFinding new indicators of risk\nGun violence and mental illness are public health problems \"that intersect at the edges\" but have very little overlap, said Jeffrey Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who specializes in gun violence and mental illness.\nIt's a phrase that frequently appears in his research and journal articles to emphasize the point that fixing the mental health system is not a silver bullet for reducing gun violence, he said. It takes multiple approaches, many of which have nothing to do with the mentally ill.\"Mental health stakeholders are loath to have this conversation about improving mental health care in a context driven by violence prevention, because that's not why we need mental health reform per se,\" Swanson said. \"We need it because people are struggling with illnesses and they don't have access to care.\"\nInstead of policies that restrict gun access based solely on mental illness diagnoses, or because a person has made contact with the judicial system or health care agencies due to mental illness, the American Psychological Association, the National Alliance on Mental Illness and other advocacy groups have called for criteria based on more subtle indicators of potentially dangerous behavior, largely informed by the work of Swanson and others.The difficulty is that policies intended to keep guns away from mentally ill people who are likely to be violent depend on clinicians' ability to accurately identify them.\nResearch shows that risk prediction, especially for statistically rare events like mass shootings, is an inexact science, \"only slightly more accurate than flipping a coin.\"\nHow, then, can policymakers strike a balance, and will Obama's executive orders address these concerns?\nIdentifying \"evidence of dangerousness\"\nObama put mental health stakeholders in a tough spot when he announced on January 5 new actions to reduce gun violence. He acknowledged the underfunded needs of a struggling population and proposed a $500 million investment toward improving access to care and treatment services.\nBut some balked at the inclusion of mental health reform in a bundle of orders aimed at reducing gun violence.\n\"The mental health community and stakeholders are very concerned about reinforcing the false association in the public's mind between mental illness and violence, because that is a source of a great deal of discrimination,\" Swanson said.\nAs Swanson and his colleagues see it, gun ownership restrictions related to mental health are too broad and too narrow all at once. They capture a lot of people because of some contact with the courts or health care system, in some cases minor or a long time ago, who are actually at low risk of perpetrating gun violence. At the same time, they miss people who have yet to be diagnosed, adjudicated mentally ill or involuntarily committed, including people who are suicidal or have pathological anger, he said.\nSwanson supports intervention at the point of purchase through comprehensive background checks. But to make background checks work, criteria for inclusion on the database should be based on other indicators of risk besides mental health history, such as pending charges or convictions for violent assault, domestic violence restraining orders or multiple DUIs. These are indicators of aggressive, impulsive or risky behavior, Swanson said.\n\"Criteria for becoming a prohibited person needs to map onto risk,\" he said. \"We need to mix criteria to make it more about contemporaneous indicators of risk.\"\nThe American Psychiatric Association also recommends firearms restriction based on \"evidence of dangerousness.\"\nThe APA has called for the development and testing of better methods to identify high-risk individuals who should be denied gun access, implying that current criteria under federal law related to mental illness are inadequate to serve as a basis for gun disqualification. On the other hand, the APA points out in its position statement that while research shows most people diagnosed with serious mental health conditions are never violent toward others, and most violent individuals do not suffer from these major mental disorders, merely having a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder should not be the only basis for disqualification from firearms.\nA number of common mental health conditions -- including personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder -- tend to be associated with the risky mix of pathological anger with gun access, according to the APA.\n\"However, only a small proportion of angry people with guns has ever been hospitalized for a mental health problem -- voluntarily or involuntarily -- and thus most would not be prohibited from firearms under the involuntary commitment exclusion.\"\nWho are the 'pathologically angry'?\nTo find out the proportion of angry people in the United States who own or carry guns and have a diagnosable mental illness, Swanson and colleagues conducted household surveys with 9,282 people from February 2001 to April 2003, excluding people who carried guns for work, resulting in a response rate of 70.9%.\nAn analysis of survey results estimated that nearly 1 in 10 adults has access to firearms and also has a problem with anger and impulsive aggressive behavior.\nThese people were more likely to be male, younger, married, and to live in outlying areas around metropolitan centers rather than in central cities, Swanson and his colleagues wrote in their report.\nThey were significantly more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a wide range of mental disorders, including depression, bipolar and anxiety disorders, PTSD, intermittent explosive disorder, pathological gambling, eating disorder, alcohol and illicit drug use disorders, and a range of personality disorders.\nWhat's more, despite evidence of \"considerable psychopathology\" in many of these respondents, only a very small proportion, 8% to 10%, were ever hospitalized for a mental health problem.\n\"Because a minority of psychiatric hospitalizations are involuntary, only a small fraction of these respondents could have had a potentially gun-disqualifying involuntary commitment,\" Swanson and his colleagues said in their report.\nSuicide prevention could have the biggest impact\nWhile mass shootings often grab the headlines, the reality is that guns are also used by thousands of individuals to end their own lives, often with little or no media attention.\nSome observers say that talking more about suicides will change the focus of the gun control debate, in part by bringing a new demographic of victims into the discussion. Where often the victims of firearm-related homicide are young black or Hispanic males, nearly 80% of those who use guns to take their own lives are white men, according to the CDC.\nAcross the population, many studies have shown that suicide risk is substantially higher in persons with mental disorders. And a growing body of research suggests that having guns in the home contributes to increased suicide risk above and beyond other risk factors such as substance abuse, a history of self-harm, hopelessness or depression.\nWhile access to mental health treatment can help alleviate risk factors for suicide, so can keeping guns out of homes of people at risk of using them to harm themselves, epidemiologists say.\nLimited research has been conducted in the United States evaluating state gun restrictions on rates of violence and suicide. Swanson and his colleagues noted this in the 2015 Annals of Epidemiology article, \"Mental illness and reduction of gun violence and suicide: Bringing epidemiologic research to policy.\" But a growing body of research points to similar conclusions regarding the effectiveness of background checks and firearms restrictions.\nA 2011 study of the impact of state firearm regulations from 1995 to 2004 found that gun permit and licensing requirements significantly lowered suicide rates among males. The findings support earlier studies of the effects of the Brady Law, which found that gun background checks and waiting periods significantly reduced suicide in the older population. Another frequently cited study from 1991 looked at the effects of restrictive handgun licensing in the District of Columbia from 1968 to 1987. The study found that a handgun ban signed into law in 1976 was followed by an abrupt decline in gun suicides. No similar reductions were seen in suicides by other means, and no reductions were seen in neighboring jurisdictions that were not subject to the law. There were also no increases in suicides by other means, suggesting that people did not substitute other methods for firearms.\nTesting solutions on the state level\nState laws restricting access to guns by requiring permits to purchase firearms also show promise for reducing suicide rates. Researchers examined suicide rates in Connecticut and Missouri, two states that recently changed their permit-to-purchase handgun laws in recent decades.\nConnecticut passed a law in 1995 that requires people to apply for a permit with local law enforcement and take eight hours of gun safety training before they can buy a firearm. In the 10 years after its passage, the rate of gun-related suicide in Connecticut was 15% lower than what researchers predict it would have been had the law not been passed.\nIn contrast, Missouri repealed a law in 2007 that required people to apply with the local police for permission to buy a gun. The gun-related suicide rate in Missouri was 16% higher from 2007 to 2011 than researchers predict it would have been, based on the rates in the comparable states of North Carolina and Nebraska.\nNone of those interventions can do anything about guns already in the home. Researchers are keeping a close eye on the effect of laws in Connecticut, Indiana and California allowing the temporary seizure of guns from people who pose an immediate threat of harm, known as gun violence restraining orders or pre-emptive gun seizure laws. While such policies could help address suicides, researchers hope they will flag so-called \"lone wolf terrorists\" or \"pseudo-commando killers\" behind mass shootings who may not be prohibited from owning a gun under current laws.\nAs Swanson and colleague Dr. Alan Felthous note in a 2015 article for Behavioral Sciences & the Law, \"Although no one would argue that they were not deeply psychologically disturbed, the fact is that killers including Jared Loughner, James Holmes, Aaron Alexis and Elliot Rodger had never been involuntarily committed and could thus legally purchase firearms.\"\nObama's proposed $500 million investment toward improving access to mental health treatment could very well catch the Loughners and the Rodgers out there. Balancing the desire to snag them upstream with the rights enshrined in the Second Amendment will continue to be a challenge for policymakers.\n\"Recent tragedies have focused attention on the fact that most people with serious mental illness do not have access to mental health treatment,\" NAMI executive director Michael Fitzpatrick said in an open letter in 2013.\n\"Misguided policies that have the effect of further limiting access to care would be ill-advised and counterproductive to the goal of improving mental health treatment.\"",

The population of Ghana is approximately 20million. Ghana has a democratic republican government, and their spoken language is English in addition to internal languages.\nThe religions practiced in Ghana include Islam, where 40% of the population follow the faith. 30% of the population are Christians, and the remaining 30% of the population follow other religions.\nThe majority of the Muslims in Ghana are situated in the north of the country, where they are approximately 80% and are in cities such Okra, Kowmasey, Barnkahowfar, Takowradee, Teema and Balack. The majority of the inhabitants are followers of the Sunni faith.\nThe majority of the Sunni Muslims in Ghana are followers of the Malki School of thought. However there are also Hanbali, Shafiee and Shia Muslims in Ghana.\nIn the 1980, the Shia school of thought spread rapidly in Ghana, this was due to the Lebanese Shia’s who migrated to Ghana and set up their businesses there.\nThe population of Shia’s in Ghana approximately one million, and they are scattered over a wide area, they are found in places such as Okra- the capital city of Ghana, Tamaleey, Kowmasey and also in Owfaseey where the whole population of this city converted to Shia Islam.\nThe Islamic centre for the Youth followers of Ahlulbayt, Imam Hussain(AS) foundation and al-Kawthar Foundation are all located in the capital city Okra as well as in other cities in Ghana. In the city of Owfaseey there is the mosque of Imam Ali al-Sajjad (AS) and in Okra there is the mosque of Ahlulbayt(AS), the mosque of Rasool Allah (PBUH) and the mosque of Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq (AS).\nThe activity of the Shia’s in Ghana are vast, they include teaching the youth Islamic classes, where the majority of the students then leave Ghana and migrate to other places to continue to higher level educations, these places include Iran and Syria. The Islamic centres celebrate and commemorate the deaths and births of the Imams and prophets as well as engage in other Islamic festivals. The Shia’s have many newspapers and magazines such as al-Kawthar magazine which is published in the English language, in the capital city Okra, there is a huge library which has many books concerning the household of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).\nThe activities which the Shia’s participate in has allowed the spread of the Shia school of thought across Ghana, and has allowed individuals to learn about the message of Shia Islam , for this reason many Muslims have converted to Shia Islam and many non-Muslims have converted to Islam.\n\nTunisia:\nTunisia is located north of the African continent. Tunisia is surrounded by countries such as Algeria and Libya. The capital city of Tunisia is Tunis. The population of Tunisia is approximately 9 million. The government in Tunisia is a republican government. The spoken language in Tunisia is Arabic as well as the French language which is spoken amongst a large number of the Tunisian people. The most practised religion in Tunisia is Islam, however there is approximately 1% of Jewish and Christian believers.\nThe majority of the Muslims in Tunisia are followers of the Maliki school of thought and approximately 85% of the Muslims follow this school of thought, there also exist a minority number of believers of the Shia school of thought. The Sufi belief is also amongst the minority of Muslim faiths in the country.\nThe Islamic history in the country is old, the year 57 AD was the first established holy site for Muslims in the city of Qirawan and from there the Islamic faith spread rapidly across Tunisia. In Qirawan there is the mosque of Aaqaba son of Nafih al-Sahibeey al-Jaleel, it is this individual who established the mosque in the year 50AD.\nThe roots of Shia Islam in Tunisia was before the Fatimid empire, and the Shia faith spread via the city of al-Mahdia al-Tunisia. The ‘Berber’ people were the first people on this land and it is through them that the message of Ahlulbayt spread.\nThe Shia faith has recently spread in Tunisia. The ‘Berber’ people, were originally the first people on Tunisian land, they also had a specific role during the time of the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (AS), and they were killed, tortured and hurt as were the people of al-Madina by the Umayyad dynasty.\nIt can be said the belief in the Household of the Prophet(PBUH) spread into Tunisia during the 1950’s / 70’s, after Tijani al-Samawi left to Iraq, it is when the light of Shia Islam started shining Tunisia.\nToday the Shia belief is found across many cities and villages in the country, if not all the cities and villages. The cities which have a major population of Shia’s are Qafsa, and the state of Qabass, Soosaa, al-Mahdia and in the capital city Tunis.\nThe activities of the Shia, include celebrating and commemorating the births/ deaths of the Holy infallibles (AS), publications of literature concerning the belief as well as other activities. There are some Shia from Tunisia who studies Islamic theology in Iran and Syria. Amongst the respected Shia scholars in Tunisia is Sayed Mohammed al-Tijani al-Samawi and Sheikh Mobarak Baghdash.\nThe Shia belief was able to spread in Tunisia due to the availability of open minded people and the lack of extreme individuals as well as the high level of educated people which is found amongst the population of Tunisians.\nAsia\n\nPakistan:\nPakistan is a country located in Asia. Pakistan is surrounded by countries such as Afghanistan, Iran and India. The capital city of Pakistan is Islamabad. The population of Pakistan exceeds 160 million. The Pakistani government is an Islamic government. The spoken languages among the Pakistani population are Urdu, Punjabi. However, the formal language of the country is English. The literal meaning of the word ‘Pakistan’ is the pure land, the purity from the Hindus when the country became separated from India in the year 1947.\nThe population of Muslim in Pakistan is 97%, the remaining 3% are Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and Sikhs. The majority of the Muslims are believers of the Sunni faith, and 74% are followers of the Hanafi school of thought and remaining Muslims are followers of the Shia School of thought.\nThe Shia population in the country of Pakistan contribute to approximately a quarter of the whole population. The Shia’s are distributed throughout the country, they are found in such places: Multan, Jhang, Faisalabad, Karachi, Hyderabad, Peshawar and Rawalpindi. The majority of the population found in the north of the country are followers of Ahlulbayt, where they form 80% of the population in places such as Baltistan and Gilgit. The presence of Shia in Pakistan stems back from the eighth century, where the Shia school of thought was spread by scholars. Amongst the great scholars who spread the message of Ahlulbayt in Pakistan was Qazi Noorullah al-Shushtari and other Ulama.\nRegardless of the fact that the Shia contribute to only a quarter of the population, the Shia have a huge impact on the politics and cultural activities of Pakistan. The Shia also have a high influence on all levels of the inhabitants of the country. Many of the ministers of the country are Shia’s, the most important being the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah as well as many generals in the military were followers of Ahlulbayt.\nThe cultural activities of the Shia in Pakistan is also highly regarded, many of the magazines and newspapers which are published are done by Shia, such publications include al-Thaqalayn.\nPakistan plays host to many educated Shia scholars, as well as many religious schools. The social activities of the Shia in Pakistan are likewise very active, where they spend a lot in the establishment of schools mosques and Islamic centres.\nThe Shia in Pakistan have a very firm hold on their belief, this is aided by the fact that in every city or village you will find an Islamic centre and a mosque, where the followers of Ahlulbayt celebrates/commemorate Islamic ceremonies.\nThe Shia of Pakistan have many holy site, one such site is that of Imam Ali (A.S.) in Parachinar.\nPublications concerning Ahlulbayt has spread rapidly throughout Pakistan, especially books of those individuals who were guided to the truth, by this way the truth of Ahlulbayt is being told to the people of Pakistan.\n\nIndonesia:\nIndonesia is a collection of many islands and is located south east of Asia, between Australia and Malaysia. The capital city of Indonesia is Jakarta, and the population of the country is 210 million, there formal spoken language is the standard Indonesian language; however there exist 400 different languages spoken collectively within the different cities in Indonesia. Indonesia is a democratic republican country.\nIndonesia is considered to have the highest population of Muslims, 89% of the population is Muslim, the remainder are Christians 8% where they are situated in the northern areas of Indonesia, and the percentage of Hindus in Indonesia is approximately 2% where the majority of them live in the area of Bali and the remainder of the population are Buddhists.\nThe establishment of Islam in Indonesia is considered to be old, the time Islam entered was during the fourth century, and furthermore, during the sixth century the spread of Islam was at its peak by aid of the traders/businessmen from India.\nThe majority of Muslims in Indonesia are Sunni’s, the Shafeeie school of thought is considered to be the vastest followed school of thought. The other schools of thought which are apparent in Indonesia are Hanafi, Malki, Hanbali and the Shia School of thought with a few Sufis( such as the Naqshabandi and Tijanya). The Indonesians are considered to be firm followers of their belief, and this is shown by the number of mosques they have in the country- there exists greater than 550 thousand mosques.\nThe history of Shia’s in Indonesia started in the fourth century, amongst them are the grandchildren of Ali son of Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq (AS) who resided in this country and many of the men married the princess-daughters of the kings in area, to the extent that some of the men obtained a very high position in the monarchy.\nThe city of Acheh which is located in the north of Sumatra, was the centre for Shia’s in Indonesia, and it is from there the Shia faith spread across Indonesia. The city of Kowal has a very high Shia population, and shortly after the independence of Indonesia, the government established an university in Kowal and called it, Shia Kowal university.\nRecently, Indonesia has seen a strong Shia movement which are lead by highly intellectual individuals. Today the population of Shia’s in the country is approximately one million, they are distributed all around the country, however, they are mainly found in Jakarta-which is the capital city of Indonesia, Bandanogh and Sowra. The Shia’s of Indonesia are firm believers of their faith. Many of the Shia’s in Indonesia have political roles in the government.\nThe Shia’s of Indonesia’s Islamic activities are vast, the spend vast amounts of money for the sake of spreading the teachings of AhlulBayt(AS) which are in the Indonesian language. They have a habitat of visiting the shrines of the fourteen infallibles also. There is a number of Islamic centres in Indonesia which belong to the Shia’s such as the Al-Hadi(AS) Institute, Al-Jawad(AS) Foundation and Al-Baqir(AS) Foundation.\nThe many mosques which belong to the Shia in Indonesia, celebrate the births of the Imams and also commemorate the deaths of the Imams.\nAt this very moment in time in Indonesia, there is a strong movement for the conversion of individuals to Shia Islam amongst the educated specifically. There have been many pieces of literature written such as the Islamic brotherhood, answering al-Dawi, the tradition of the al-Thaqalyn and many books concerning the tragedy of Karbala. There are also lectures given regarding the Shia belief which attract people to the Shia belief.\nSouth America\n\nBrazil:\nBrazil is located in the middle of the south American continent, its capital city is Brasilia. Brazil has a federal government. The population of Brazil is 170milion, the most frequent spoken language in Brazil is Portuguese, however, the French, English and the Spanish languages are also spoken in moderation. 89% of the Brazilian population are Christians of which the majority are catholic. The remaining 11% are of other faiths. The government has proclaimed Brazil as a country of democracy of faiths, where everyone can practice the faith they wish. The population of Muslim is not greater than 3 million, and they are largely located in west of Brazil, in Sao Paulo.\nIslam reached Brazil through worshipers who migrated to Brazil from Africa, and also from immigrants during the Ottoman empire, where Rio Janeiro was a station were Muslim captives from Africa were brought to, this is how the city learned about Islam. The Portuguese colonisation helped stabilise the situation of Muslims in Brazil by stopping the killing of Muslims. One should note that one main factor which helped the stabilization of Islam in the area was the existence of Islamic and Arabic monuments. In the city of Bahia, which is predominant in immigrants from Africa, exists many scriptures in the Arabic language, there also exists Arabic words in the streets of Brazil. In modern history (in the late 50’s) Brazil understood about Islam through businessmen from aboard. Islamic centres were established which celebrate many Islamic occasions. The first mosque to be built in Brazil was in 1950in the city of Sao Paulo, and today in Brazil there exists more than 60 Islamic centres and 40 mosques.\nOn the other hand, the existence of Shia is linked to the time of the Ottoman Empire, and the Shia escaped to Brazil to escape from military presence. The Shia first went to Argentina and then to Brazil. During the first half of this century, there occurred a mass immigration of Lebanese to Brazil, which lead to the increase of Shia Islam in the area. The population of Shia in Brazil is approximately one million, and they contribute to 40% of the Muslims in the country.

The Shia also publish many publications concerning the Shia school of thought. Many of the Shia books have been translated to the Portuguese language- such books include: Nahjul Balagha-Peak of Equivalence, The Woman’s rights in Islam and many other publications.\nIn the past, the Shia’s were not viewed with pleasure, do to propaganda made by oppositions of AhlulBayt(AS), however, today the Shia’s in Brazil are treated with respect from both Sunni’s as well as believers of other faiths. During the year, both Sunni and Shia scholars exchange visits with each other, and a theme of united Muslims is shown.",

CNN Business confirmed the bug multiple times in its own tests.\nApple said in a statement Monday night that it has identified a fix for the problem and will release it in a software update later this week. In the meantime, Apple's website indicates Group FaceTime is unavailable, and the company confirmed it has started disabling the Group FaceTime feature for all users.\nThe bug works on iPhones and iPads running iOS 12.1, and Apple PCs running macOS Mojave, which have the recently added Group FaceTime feature.\nWhen the bug is activated, the person who initiated the call is able to hear the live audio on the other person's phone, even though the recipient has not accepted the call. And their screen gives no indication that their conversation is being transmitted. In some cases, the bug can also show live video of the other person if they press a volume button to dismiss the call.\nCNN senior editor Brian Ries successfully used it on friends, family members and a colleague, and in one instance was even able to see video of the people he was calling.\nTo avoid falling victim to the bug, disable FaceTime on all your devices until Apple's software updates have been released.\nOn an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings -> FaceTime, and toggle off the green button at the top of the screen.

    "content": "Spain has become the first western European country to record more than half a million Covid-19 cases, logging a total of 525,549 infections as concerns also grow over the rise in cases in France and the UK.\n\nThe Spanish milestone comes amid a continuing surge in infections as millions of children begin returning to school after a six-month hiatus.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the health ministry, Spain has logged 49,716 new cases in the past week, and 237 deaths. Around a third of the new cases and deaths are in Madrid, the region hardest hit by the pandemic.\n\nSpain has the fastest rise in daily confirmed cases in Europe, which began a climb in July, with France showing a similar increase beginning in August.\n\nThe UK has recorded 349,500 cases, France 347,268 and Italy 277,634.\n\nA UK government source said there was significant concern that the UK was “six weeks behind France”, while Matt Hancock, the British health secretary, on Monday described the recent rises as concerning.\n\nWhen the pandemic was at its peak on 31 March, Spain had 9,222 new cases and 849 deaths in a single day. In Madrid’s hospitals, 18% of beds are occupied by Covid patients, compared with a national average of 7%.\n\nFernando Simón, the head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies, has acknowledged the rise in infections, but pointed out that 50% of new cases are asymptomatic and more than half of them are in people under 40 – who are at a lower risk of death.\n\nÁngela Hernández Puente, a surgeon and deputy general secretary of Madrid’s Amtys medical association, said the current situation was very worrying but not comparable with the overwhelming pressure the health system was under in March and widespread testing was leading to the diagnosis of many mild and asymptomatic cases.\n\nShe warned, however, that the hard-won gains of Spain’s lockdown – one of Europe’s strictest – were being squandered by irresponsible behaviour and a lack of proper preparations. “If we can’t stop the spread of the virus, we’ll start seeing what we saw in March once again,” she said.\n\n“People need to act responsibly on an individual basis – by wearing a mask, washing their hands and maintaining social distancing. On a public health level, we need really exhaustive contact tracing, which, unfortunately, we haven’t been seeing. We brought transmission really low during the lockdown but we didn’t back it up by investing in frontline public health and it’s starting to get away from us again.”While some have suggested that Spain’s sociable and gregarious culture may have helped spread the virus following the end of the three-month lockdown, Ildefonso Hernández-Aguado, professor at the Miguel Hernández University in Alicante and a former director general of public health for the Spanish government, said there was no simple explanation.\n\n“I don’t think the cultural question is enough to explain it, because I don’t think we’re that different to the Italians or the Portuguese,” he said.\n\nHernández-Aguado said some regions had failed to invest in contact tracing but there was also a lack of firm behavioural information. “We also need to understand why young people are really good at wearing masks when they walk down the street, but then take them off when they sit down to have a beer.”\n\nRafael Bengoa, co-director of the Institute for Health and Strategy in Bilbao, said Covid was a “slowburn” pandemic that had laid bare years of underinvestment in public health, and warned that a series of “micro-lockdowns” would probably be required in Spain.\n\n“If you have a weak public health infrastructure and your track-and-trace is also weak, you end up with a kind of fragmented patchwork of interventions,” he said.\n\n“Some parts of Spain are doing worse than others and have clear community transmission so the numbers there keep going up. There comes a point when community transmission is so high that you can’t do track-and-trace and you need small lockdowns. I think the most affected parts of Spain are going to need to have micro-lockdowns to get the situation under control.”\n\nThe Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on Monday sought to reassure worried parents as children continued a staggered return to school more than two months after the government lifted lockdown. All pupils in all regions will be back by the end of the month and children over six will have to wear face masks.\n\n“There’s no such thing as zero risk,” he told Spanish television. “But our children and teachers will have the guarantee of being in safe centres. Parents can be calm.”\n\nThe regional president of Madrid was last week blunter, warning that almost all the children about to return to school in the region were likely to pick up the virus over the coming months because the stringent measures in place in the classroom were not being observed at family gatherings or in parks. Madrid on Monday banned gatherings of more than 10 people and announced the number of contact tracers in the region will almost double, rising from 560 to around 1,100.\n\nA leading epidemiologist in France has warned that if the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise at the current rate, the country could face a “critical situation” in several regions in December as it recorded a further 7,071 new cases on Sunday evening, following an increase of around 8,500 on Saturday and almost 9,000 new cases on Friday.\n\n“Today, we have a rise in the number of new cases a week of 30% and a 15% increase in the number of hospital admissions a week,” Prof Antoine Fontanet told the LCI news channel. “If this rhythm continues, we will reach a critical situation in several regions of France in December. It is better to act now; the earlier we act the less strict the measures will be and the fewer there will be.”\n\nOn Sunday almost 3,000 people in the UK tested positive for Covid-19, a 50% increase in a single day and the highest daily total since May.\n\n“This virus can spread rapidly, exploiting any opportunity we give it – and we are giving it many by giving up on things that have worked so far,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n“Worse, we have wasted months failing to build a fully functioning testing and tracing system. Any predictions must be made with caution but the risk of following Spain remains high until we develop a joined-up strategy with ambition, what we have called a zero Covid strategy that has been adopted elsewhere.”\n\nPaul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said there was not an “apples-to-apples comparison” in terms of the case counts between European countries but tourism and transmission in younger people appear to implicated in the rises.\n\n“Reports of cases in Mediterranean countries have highlighted the spread in younger people. And I think I think that is almost certainly the case. And you could pretty much know that by the fact the death toll is so much lower than it was in March, April, which is a pretty good indicator that the average age of cases is so much lower.”\n\nHe said the predominant spread in cases in the UK was also due to transmission in younger people, such as teenagers and young adults, but that could mean a peak in cases in December and January.\n\n“Unfortunately, it’s never going to stay in that group because teenagers and young adults are at risk of passing it on to elder relatives, relatives who might have other vulnerabilities that would make them more likely to succumb. So I think we’re likely to see an increase in deaths, which will probably not become really noticeable by the end of this month.”",

    "content": "Venus might not be a sweltering, waterless hellscape today, if Jupiter hadn't altered its orbit around the sun, according to new UC Riverside research.Jupiter has a mass that is two-and-a-half times that of all other planets in our solar system—combined. Because it is comparatively gigantic, it has the ability to disturb other planets' orbits.\n\nEarly in Jupiter's formation as a planet, it moved closer to and then away from the sun due to interactions with the disc from which planets form as well as the other giant planets. This movement in turn affected Venus.\n\nObservations of other planetary systems have shown that similar giant planet migrations soon after formation may be a relatively common occurrence. These are among the findings of a new study published in the Planetary Science Journal.\n\nScientists consider planets lacking liquid water to be incapable of hosting life as we know it. Though Venus may have lost some water early on for other reasons, and may have continued to do so anyway, UCR astrobiologist Stephen Kane said that Jupiter's movement likely triggered Venus onto a path toward its current, inhospitable state.\n\n\"One of the interesting things about the Venus of today is that its orbit is almost perfectly circular,\" said Kane, who led the study. \"With this project, I wanted to explore whether the orbit has always been circular and if not, what are the implications of that?\"\n\nTo answer these questions, Kane created a model that simulated the solar system, calculating the location of all the planets at any one time and how they pull one another in different directions.\n\nScientists measure how noncircular a planet's orbit is between 0, which is completely circular, and 1, which is not circular at all. The number between 0 and 1 is called the eccentricity of the orbit. An orbit with an eccentricity of 1 would not even complete an orbit around a star; it would simply launch into space, Kane said.\n\nCurrently, the orbit of Venus is measured at 0.006, which is the most circular of any planet in our solar system. However, Kane's model shows that when Jupiter was likely closer to the sun about a billion years ago, Venus likely had an eccentricity of 0.3, and there is a much higher probability that it was habitable then.\n\n\"As Jupiter migrated, Venus would have gone through dramatic changes in climate, heating up then cooling off and increasingly losing its water into the atmosphere,\" Kane said.\n\nRecently, scientists generated much excitement by discovering a gas in the clouds above Venus that may indicate the presence of life. The gas, phosphine, is typically produced by microbes, and Kane says it is possible that the gas represents \"the last surviving species on a planet that went through a dramatic change in its environment.\"\n\nFor that to be the case, however, Kane notes the microbes would have had to sustain their presence in the sulfuric acid clouds above Venus for roughly a billion years since Venus last had surface liquid water—a difficult to imagine though not impossible scenario.\n\n\"There are probably a lot of other processes that could produce the gas that haven't yet been explored,\" Kane said.\n\nUltimately, Kane says it is important to understand what happened to Venus, a planet that was once likely habitable and now has surface temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"I focus on the differences between Venus and Earth, and what went wrong for Venus, so we can gain insight into how the Earth is habitable, and what we can do to shepherd this planet as best we can,\" Kane said.",

    "content": "The imperial Palace in Tokyo used to declare its budget on a single piece of paper, with only the barest of details. Now a new book has given the Japanese an unprecedented glimpse into royal life - and how Emperor Akihito spends his annual £150 million of public money.\n\nRevealed for the first time is a staff list that includes four doctors on call 24 hours a day, five men who attend to his wardrobe and 11 who assist him in Shinto rites. In all, Japan's royal family commands a legion of more than 1,000 people, including a 24-piece orchestra, 30 gardeners, 25 cooks and 78 plumbers, electricians and builders.\n\nThe main imperial palace, in Tokyo, home to Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, requires 160 servants to keep it running - partly because of rules like one that a maid who wipes a table cannot also wipe the floor, according to The Imperial Family Purse. Meanwhile the emperor and his family run up a monthly water bill of £50,000.\n\nThe book, which is opening up public debate about the role of the imperial family, draws on some 200 documents made available for the first time under a new public information law. Until now, facts about spending were hidden behind the so-called Chrysanthemum Curtain, which keeps secret much of the Japanese royal family's life.\n\n\"Compared to the time when no information was available, this is an epochal step forward,\" writes the book's author, Yohei Mori, former royal correspondent for the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.\n\nEven so, the Imperial Household Agency refused to consider follow-up questions until they were supplied in writing, in Japanese, and was then unable to respond last week.\n\nMr Mori points out that in addition to the emperor's own doctors, his palace has a £2 million-a-year clinic with 42 staff and eight medical departments, but only 28 visitors a day. The room in which Crown Princess Masako gave birth to Princess Aiko two years ago was redecorated beforehand at a cost of £140,000.\n\nA special 961-strong police force guards the imperial family and their residences at a cost of £48 million.\n\nThe emperor spent £140,000 building a new wine cellar, which stores 4,500 bottles of 11 types of white wine and seven types of red. When President Mbeki of South Africa visited Japan in 2001 he was served Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1982, which today costs more than £300 a bottle, and Dom Perignon 1992 champagne.\n\nThe Japanese imperial family consists of an inner court of six: the emperor and empress; Princess Sayako, their unmarried daughter; Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako and their daughter.\n\nBut the civil list covers a further 19 family members who also live in imperial residences, although they are not forbidden to hold other jobs or run businesses. Prince Tomohito, a cousin of the emperor, and his wife and two daughters, both university students, receive a total of £310,000 a year, even though their royal duties are light and few Japanese even know who they are.\n\nMr Mori says discussion about the imperial purse has been stifled by secrecy and a lack of scrutiny by the politicians who approve the budget. \"Immediately after the war, there was some level of debate,\" he writes. \"But a sense of taboo means that people have come to avoid peering into the imperial household's economy.\"\n\nThe book, which has sold some 36,000 copies so far, reveals that imperial men outside the direct line of succession receive twice as much money from the civil list as their wives.\n\nThe system was devised in an era when imperial women stayed largely within the palace grounds, but Princess Sayako has visited 12 countries on official trips since her father succeeded to the throne in 1989.\n\nAmong the imperial properties is a 622-acre farm which provides milk, meat and vegetables for the imperial family at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £3 million. The farm once ran at a profit because it bred prizewinning racehorses but this was stopped in 1969.\n\nMuch of the imperial family's wealth was confiscated after the Second World War by the American occupation authorities, who viewed it as a barrier to building a democracy. By the time Emperor Hirohito died, he left personal property worth £11 million. The imperial palaces are all owned and paid for by the state.\n\nThere is some restraint in spending, at least. When the emperor travels, his entourage pays just £110 a night, no matter how expensive the hotel. Owners put up with this because none will risk losing the honour of hosting the imperial family.",

It is a dictionary of slang.\n   Jargon consists of technical words that are needed for very\nprecise communication in a specialized subject. Economists, truck\ndrivers, chemists, and steelworkers all use a specialized vocabulary to\nconvey technical meanings.\n   Slang, on the other hand, is used for fun, for human communication\nrather than technical communication. Slang is often derived from\njargon. When a bit of technical jargon is used in an extended or\nmetaphorical way, it becomes slang.\n   Many \"computer\" words are making their way into everyday use.\nThanks to the proliferation of home computers, many people have heard\nof bytes, RAM, memory banks, terminals, processors, and floppy disks.\n   You won't find those words defined here.

I remember stumbling around racks full of circuit boards\nand wires, a screeching cabinet that printed a full page every six\nseconds, and rows of blinking lights: the computer room was crammed\nfull of equipment with no obvious organization. One set of gray\ncabinets had some trophies and plaques sitting on it: this was the\nPDP-6 computer that, running a program called MacHack, consistently won\nprizes by outwitting human players in chess tournaments. This PDP-6 was\nalso versatile: it had two speakers and a stereo amplifier sitting on\ntop of it. The hacker typed a couple of commands on a keyboard, and the\nPDP-6 burst into a Bach Brandenburg Concerto (no. 6, as I recall).\n   One part of that tour stands out most clearly in my mind. I was\ntold to sit down in front of a large, round, glass screen, and given a\nbox that had some buttons and a stick on the top. My hacker guide typed\na command on the keyboard, and suddenly, green and purple space ships\nappeared on the screen! The purple one started shooting little red dots\nat the green one, which was soon obliterated in a multicolored shower\nof sparkles. The green ship was \"mine\", and the hacker had expertly\nshot it down. This was a color version of Space War, one of the very\nfirst video games.\n   Remember that this was years before \"Apple\" and \"TRS-80\" had\nbecome household words. Back then computers were still rather mys-\nterious, hidden away in giant corporations and university laboratories.\n   Playing Space War was fun, but I learned nothing of programming\nthen. I had the true fascination of computers revealed to me in\nNovember, 1968, when a chum slipped me the news that our school (Boston\nLatin School, of Boston, Massachusetts) had an IBM computer locked up\nin the basement. I was dubious. I had earlier narrowly avoided buying\nfrom a senior a ticket to the fourth-floor swimming pool (Boston Latin\nhas only three stories, and no swimming pool at all), and assumed this\nwas another scam. So of course I laughed in his face.\n   When he persisted, I checked it out. Sure enough, in a locked\nbasement room was and IBM 1130 computer. If you want all the specs:\n4096 words of memory, 16 bits per word, a 15-character-per-second\nSelectric (\"golf ball\") printer, and a card reader (model 1442) that\ncould read 300 cards per minute. Yes, this was back in the days of\npunched cards. Personal computers were completely unheard-of then.\nNominally the computer was for the training of juniors and seniors, but\nI cajoled a math teacher into lending me a computer manual and spent\nall of Thanksgiving vacation reading it.\n   I was hooked.\n   No doubt about it. I was born to be a hacker. Fortunately, I\ndidn't let my studies suffer (as many young hackers do), but every\nspare moment I thought about the computer. It was spellbinding. I\nwanted to know all about it: what it could and couldn't do, how its\nprograms worked, what its circuits looked like. During study halls,\n\nlunch, and after school, I could be found in the computer room,\npunching programs onto cards and running them through the computer.\n\n   I was not the only one. Very soon there was a small community of\nIBM 1130 hackers. We helped to maintain the computer and we tutored our\nless fanatical fellow students in the ways of computing. What could\npossibly compensate us for these chores? Free rein in the computer\nroom.\n   Soon after that, I developed into one of the unauthorized but\ntolerated \"random people\" hanging around the MIT Artificial Intel-\nligence Laboratory much as a groupie is to a rock band: not really\ndoing useful work, but emotionally involved and contributing to the\nambiance, if nothing else. After a while, I was haunting the computer\nrooms at off-hours, talking to people but more often looking for\nchances to run programs. Sometimes \"randoms\" such as I were quite\nhelpful, operating the computers for no pay and giving advice to\ncollege students who were having trouble. Sometimes, however, we were\nquite a nuisance. Once, I was ejected from the Artificial Intelligence\nLaboratory by none other than Richard Greenblatt, the very famous\nhacker who wrote the MacHack program with which the PDP-6 had won its\nchess trophies. He threw me out because I was monopolizing the one\nterminal that produced letter-quality copy. (I was using the computer\nto write \"personalized\" form letters to various computer manufacturers,\nasking for machine manuals.) I deserved to be tossed out, and gave him\nno argument. But when you're hooked, you're hooked, and I was un-\ndaunted: within a week or two I was back again.\n\n   Eventually I got a part-time job as a programmer at MIT's Project\nMAC computer laboratory. There I became a full-fledged member of the\nhacker community, and ultimately an MIT graduate student.\n   I was never a lone hacker, but one of many. Despite stories you\nmay have read about anti-social nerds glued permanently to display\nscreens, totally addicted to the computer, hackers have (human) friends\ntoo. Often these friendships are formed and maintained through the\ncomputer.\n   At one time, the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory had one\ncommon telephone number, extension 6765, and a public-address system.\nThe phone was answered \"six-seven-six-five\", or sometimes \"Fibonacci of\ntwenty\", since, as mathematician know, 6765 is the twentieth Fibonacci\nnumber. Through this number and the public-address system, it was easy\nto cal and reach anyone and everyone. In particular, one could easily\nask, \"Who wants to go for Chinese food?\" and get ten or fifteen people\nfor an expedition.\n   \"Unfortunately\", says MIT hacker Richard Stallman, \"most of the\npeople and terminals have moved to other floors, where the 6765 number\ndoes not reach. The ninth floor, the lab's ancient heart, is becoming\ntotally filled with machines, leaving no room for people, who must move\nto other floors. Now I can't even call up and find out if anyone is\nhungry.\"\n   Stallman can, however, still call us all up using the computer.\nThrough timesharing (where many people use one computer) and networking\n(where many computers are connected together), the computer makes\npossible a new form of human communication, better than the telephone\nand the postal system put together. You can send a message by elec-\ntronic mail and get a reply within two minutes, or you can just link\ntwo terminals together and have a conversation.\n   MIT has no monopoly on hackers. In the 1960s and 1970s hackers\ncongregated around any computer center that made computer time\nvailable for \"play\". (Some of this play turned out to be very\nimportant work, but hacking is done mostly for fun, for its own sake,\nfor the pure joy of it). Because universities tend to be more flexible\nthan corporations in this regard, most hackers' dens arose in uni-\nversity laboratories. While some of these hackers were unauthorized\n\"random people\" like me, many hackers were paid employees who chose to\nstay after hours and work on their own projects -- or even continue\ntheir usual work -- purely for pleasure.\n   The hacker community became still larger and more closely knit in\nthe early 1970s, when the government funded a project to see whether it\nwould be useful to let the computers at dozens of universities and\nother sites \"talk\" to each other. The project succeeded and produced\nthe famous ARPANET, a network that now links hundreds of computers\nacross the country. Through the ARPANET, researchers can share\nprograms, trade research results, and send electronic mail -- both to\nindividuals and to massive mailing lists. Best of all, it allowed\nonce-isolated hackers to talk to each other via computer.\n   The result is a nation-wide hackers' community, now one decade\nold. In some ways the community serves as a geographically dispersed\nthink tank. When Rubik's Cube became popular, one hacker created an\nelectronic mailing list of \"Cube hackers\". (Such mailing lists are\nroutinely created for new topics of interest). The network buzzed, and\ncontinues to buzz, with exposition of some very deep mathematics in\nefforts to solve various puzzles about the Cube. What, for example, is\nthe smallest number of twists required to solve the Cube? This question\nis still unanswered; but some progress has been make, and hackers\nacross the country continue to discuss and to fret over its solution\nvia computer.\n   Hackers do more than talk, however; they hack. Although no two\npeople are alike, there are certain traits that are typical of hacker.\nThe cardinal qualification is that hackers like to use computers. The\nword CYCLE, as used by hackers, refers to the fundamental unit of work\ndone by a computer, so we say that hackers crave cycles. The more\ncycles available, the more a hacker gets out of the computer.\n   As a direct result of this craving, a hacker will frequently wake\nup at dinner time and go to bed after breakfast, or perhaps get up at\nnoon and sack out a 4:00 A.M. (See the terms PHASE and NIGHT MODE for\nmore information on hackers' sleeping schedules.) Hackers do this\nbecause the computer has its own circadian rhythms to which hackers\nwillingly adjust themselves. These rhythms in turn grow out of the\nheavier demands for the computer during the day than at night. Hackers\nwill therefore work late into the evening or night, when other computer\nusers aren't competing for cycles. It's more fun, after all, to use the\ncomputer when it's responding at split-second speeds.\n\n   Most such hackers are single. Hackers do get married, but the res-\nponsibilities of family life don't always mix well with typical hacker\nlife style. When I was at MIT, I would sometimes work nights for a\nmonth at a time. Now that I am married, I find that I can hack only in\nspurts, one or two days a week. This book, by the way, is a hack of\nsorts. The manuscript was prepared using a computer, and nearly all of\nthe work was done after midnight.\n   The truly dedicated hacker does little else but eat, sleep, and\nhack. Of these activities, eating is the only social activity, so\nrather than eat at home alone, a hacker will usually go out to eat with\nhis hacker friends. While hackers may sleep according to different\nschedules, most arrange to be awake and at the laboratory around 6:00\nP.M., at which time one or more dinner expeditions usually head out.\n   For some reason, Chinese food is particularly favored by most\nhackers. You will find several references to Chinese Szechuan and Hunan\ncuisine in this dictionary. Other spicy cuisines, such as Mexican and\nIndian, are also enjoyed by hackers, but Chinese is the definite\nfavorite.\n   Many shorthand expressions have developed for discussing food and\nlocal restaurants. At MIT one might hear:\n\"Foodp?\"; \"Smallp?\"; \"T.\"; \"T!\"\n Translated, this means roughly:\n \"Do you want to eat now?\"\n \"Maybe; what do would you think of going to Joyce Chen's Small\nEating Place?\"\n \"Okay by me.\"\n \"Then I'll join you!\"\n\n   When you walk up to the terminal of a time-shared computer, the\nfirst thing you must do is to \"log in\", that is, tell the computer who\nyou are. To do this, you type your \"computer i.d.\" or \"login name\".\nDifferent computers have different ideas of what a login name should\nbe. Some use numbers or other codes (see the entry for PPN), some use\nyour last name, some use your initials. Many computers limit login\nnames to either three or six characters, so full names or last names\ncan't be used in general.\n   As a result everyone acquires a login name, which you need to know\nto communicate with other hacker via computer. A login name serves in\nmuch the same way as a CB \"handle\". I have friends whom I know only by\nlogin name; I have no idea what their real names are. Once, at a\nwedding, I ran into a good hacker friend who was also a guest there. I\nrecalled his login name instantly, but was embarrassed that I couldn't\nimmediately remember his real name in order to introduce him to a third\nperson. It was SWAPPED OUT.\n   Login names are often used as nicknames, pronounces if possible\nand spelled if necessary. My wife and I met at MIT, and she still calls\nme \"Gliss\", because my login name was GLS. \"Guy\" sounds very weird to\nher. Some hackers (including Richard Stallman) actually prefer to be\ncalled by their login name.\n   Because of the design and use of computers depend on other\nbranches of science, a hacker has to have some knowledge of ma-\nthematics, physics, electronics, and other disciplines. Hackers\ntypically have many other interests as well: science fiction, music,\nand chess are particularly popular.\n   The common them, however, is the love of the computer. Hackers\ndiscuss science fiction through computerized mailing lists. A hacker is\nless likely to listen to music than to program a computer to play\nmusic. A hacker who can play only a middling game of chess can write a\nprogram that wins chess tournaments. Such are the compensations of a\nlife at the keyboard.\n                                          Happy hacking!\n\n\n\n                A Hackish Note on How to Use This Book\n                   By Raphael Finkel and Don Woods\n\n   While hackers necessarily design and use unspeakable languages to\ncontrol computers, they also have an unusual spoken language. Just as\nstrange language had first attracted many of us to computers, we were\nstruck by the queer vocabulary hackers would use to describe not only\ncomputer-related things but the wide world as well. Finkel decided to\nbuild a lexicon of the strange words and expressions that set this\ncommunity apart, and the rest of us added to it over the years.\n   A lot of our slang can be figured out from context. Don Woods once\ntold a waitress, \"I think we're ready to go, MODULO paying the check\".\nAnd there's the time he asked a flight attendant to \"please SNARF me a\nmagazine\". Neither of them batted an eye. It is the most commonly used\njargon words -- the ones loaded with subtle connotations accumulated\nover the years -- that are the hardest to define.\n   This book is arranged as a dictionary, and you may skip around\nreading individual definitions if you please. However, definitions\noccurring later in the book purposely build on earlier ones, and we\nthink you will get more fun out of it if you read the book straight\nthrough in alphabetical order.\n   We want to warn the reader that not all the expressions you will\nfind here are in common use. Many are regional; some are obsolete. Some\nare used every day, and others are heard only occasionally. To give you\nan idea, here is a list of out favorite and perhaps most frequently\nused words:\n\n      BAR                     BOGOSITY          CRUFTY\n      BARF                    BOGUS             FEATURE\n      BAZ                     BUG               FLAME\n      BELLS AND WHISTLES   CANONICAL         FLAVOR\n      FLUSH                   LOSER             PHASE OF THE MOON\n      FOO                     MAGIC             RANDOM\n      FOOBAR                  MOBY              THE REAL WORLD\n      FROB                    MODULO            SNARF\n      HACK                    MUMBLE            VANILLA\n      KLUDGE                  PHASE             WIZARD\n\n   By and large, computer people have an enormous range of in-\ntellectual interests; you will see this fact reflected in the lexicon.\nWhile they use slang for fun, most computer people are highly literate,\nhighly articulate, and sticklers for grammar. Don't expect to impress\npeople by overusing the words you find here. They are the spice, not\nthe bread and butter, of everyday conversation.\n\n                       Grokking Hacker Grammar\n\n   For the most part, hackerese fits within the framework of ordinary\nEnglish speech. There are but a few rules, however, that are unusual in\neveryday English but are very commonly used in hackerese. (These extra\nrules of grammar reflect the fact that hackers enjoy playing with\nlanguage. Most are quite aware of when they are breaking the rules of\nstandard English).\n\nVerb doubling\n\n   A standard construction in English is to double a verb and use it\nas an exclamation, such as \"bang, bang!\" or \"quack, quack!\". Most of\nthese are names for noises. Hackers also double verbs as a concise,\nsometimes sarcastic, comment on what the implied subject does. Also, a\ndoubled verb is often used to terminate a conversation -- in the\nprocess, remarking on the current state of affairs or what the speaker\nintends to do next. Verbs frequently doubled include WIN, HACK, FLAME,\nBARF, and CHOMP. Typical examples of usage:\n   \"The disk heads just crashed. Lose, lose.\"\n   \"Mostly he just talked about his latest crock. Flame, flame.\"\n   \"I think I'll go fix that bug now. Hack, hack!\"\nStandard doublings with subtle connotations are listed individually in\nthe lexicon.\n\nSound-alike Slang\n\n   In the manner of cockney rhyming slang, hackers will often make\nrhymes or puns in order to convert an ordinary word of phrase into\nsomething more interesting. It is particularly FLAVORFUL if the phrase\nis bent so as to include some other slang word; thus, the computer\nhobbyist magazine Dr. Dobb's Journal is almost always referred to among\n\nhackers as Dr. Frob's Journal. Terms of this kind in fairly wide use\ninclude names for newspapers:\n   Boston Herald American becomes Horrid (or Harried) American.\n   Boston Globe becomes Boston Glob.\n   San Francisco Chronicle becomes the Crocknicle.\n   New York Times becomes New York Slime\nOther standard terms include:\n   \"For historical reasons\" becomes \"for hysterical raisins\"\n\"Margaret Hacks Hall\" (a building at Stanford) becomes \"Marginal\nHacks Hall\".\n\"Government property -- do not duplicate\" (seen on keys at MIT) is\nusually quoted as \"Government duplicity -- do not propagate\"\n\nThe -P Convention\n\n   This rule is unique, used by no one but hackers. A word or phrase\nis turned onto a yes/no question by appending the letter P, which is\npronounced as a separate syllable when spoken. This rule is derived\nfrom a convention of LISP programming language, where the letter P at\nthe end of a name denotes a \"predicate\" -- that is, a function that\nreturns \"true\" or \"false\" as its result.\n   For example, the question \"Foodp?\" (pronounced \"food'pee\", with\nthe voice rising as for any question) means \"Do you want to eat now?\"\nThe question \"Colleen's-p?\" is more specific: \"Do you want to go eat at\nColleen's Chinese cuisine (a favorite restaurant near MIT)?\" \"Lose-p?\"\nmeans \"Are you LOSING?\" or \"Is it LOSING?\". And so on.\n   As a special case, the question \"State-of-the-world-p?\" means\n\"What's going on?\" or \"What are you doing (or about to do)?\" The -P\nconvention is used for this even though it isn't a yes/no question. A\ntypical answer might be \"The SYSTEM just CRASHED\" or \"I'm about to\nGRONK OUT\". If the responder is feeling silly or obstinate, however, he\nwill insist on interpreting it as a yes/no question after all, and\nrespond with \"Yes, the world has a state.\"\n   The -P convention is often applied to new words at the spur of the\nmoment. The best of these is a GOSPERISM (that is, invented by R.\nWilliam Gosper). When we were at a Chinese restaurant, he wanted to\nknow whether someone would like to share with him a two-person-sized\nbowl of soup. His inquiry was \"Split-p soup?\" and everyone instantly\nknew what he meant. (After all, split pea soup was not on the menu).\n\nOvergeneralisation\n\n   Hackers love to take advantage of the inconsistencies of English\nby extending a general rule to cases where it doesn't apply. Children\nroutinely do this when they say \"teached\" for \"taught\" or \"He goed\nthere\" for \"He went there\". Hackers do this quite intentionally for\nmore complicated words. One example:\n   \"Generous\" becomes \"generosity\".\n   \"Porous\" becomes \"porosity\".\n   \"Curious\" becomes \"curiosity\".\nTherefore:\n   \"Mysterious\" becomes \"mysteriosity\".\n   \"Obvious\" becomes \"obviosity\".\n   \"Dubious\" becomes \"dubiosity\".\nLess clearly:\n   \"Bogus\" becomes \"bogosity\".\nAnd, perhaps:\n   \"Ferrous\" becomes \"ferocity\"!\nOther examples: winnitude, disustitude, hackitude, hackification.\n\nSpoken Inarticulations\n\n   Words such a \"mumble\", \"sigh\", and \"groan\" are spoken in places\nwhere their referent might more naturally be used. It has been\nsuggested that this usage derives from the impossibility of re-\npresenting such noises in conversation by computer (see COM MODE); one\ngets so used to typing \"Sigh!\" to indicate a sigh that one soon\ndevelops the vocal habit  of saying the word instead of actually\nsighing. Another expression sometimes heard is \"complain!\" (meaning not\n\"You, complain!\" but \"I have a complaint!\")\n\nHow to Make Hacker Noises\n\n   Many of the words in this dictionary are ordinary English words\nthat have acquired new meanings. Some appear to be English words but\nare pronounced differently, and many are new words. To keep things\nsimple, we have included pronunciations only in the unusual cases. If\nno pronunciation is given for a word, it should be pronounced as an\nordinary English word.\n   Also for simplicity, we do not use the complicated alphabets and\npronunciation marks used in most dictionaries. These alphabets, such as\nthe International Phonetic Alphabet, allow a very precise description\nof pronunciation but are hard to read if you're not familiar with them.\n   We use the following simplified system: Syllables are separated by\nhyphens, except that an apostrophe follows an accented syllable.\nConsonants are pronounced as they usually are in English. The letter g\nis always hard, as in \"got\" rather than in \"giant\"; ch is always soft,\nas in \"child\" rather than \"chemist\". The letter s is always as in\n\"pass\", never a z sound as in \"has\"; but to prevent confusion, ss is\nsometimes used at the end of a syllable to emphasize this. Other\nconsonants are also occasionally doubled for the same reason. The\nletter h always contains the leading d sound as used twice in \"judge\".\nVowel sounds are represented as shown in the following table:\n         a     back, that\n         ay    bake, rain\n         ah    cot, father\n         aw    flaw, caught\n         e     less, men\n         ee    easy, ski\n         i     trip, hit\n         ie    life, sky\n         ow    out, how\n\n         oh    flow, sew\n         oy    boy, coin\n         uh    but, some\n         u     put, foot\n         oo    loot, through\n         y     yet\n         yoo   few\n\n   A colon -- \":\" -- is used for the \"schwa\" sound that is often\nwritten as an upside-down e. For example, the pronunciation of \"kitten\"\nwould be kit':n, and of \"magical\" would be maj'i-k:l.\n\n\nSome Overflow in PDL\n\n   Various abbreviations are used throughout these definitions. Most\nrefer to computer hardware and software. For example, one of the\nfavorite computer languages in our hacker community is LISP. The two\npoles of the hacker's network that compiled this dictionary are the\nartificial intelligence laboratories at Stanford and MIT, and LISP has\nalways been one language of choice for artificial intelligence\nresearch. A particular computer, the Digital Equipment Corporation\n(DEC) PDP-6, and its successors (the PDP-10 and DECSYSTEM-20) have\nuntil recently been the computers of choice for running LISP. The\nconsequence is that technical words from the LISP language and the\nPDP-10 computer will occasionally appear in this dictionary. The EMACS\ntext editor, also referred to, was one of the first \"display editors\"\nto be widely distributed. It is used as a standard against which new\ntext editors for personal computers are measured. We have tried to keep\nsuch words to a minimum throughout.\n\n\n\n\nAOS (owss [East coast], ay'ahss [West coast]) verb.\n   1. To add one to a number. Example: \"Every time the computer finds\na bad file it aoses the bad-file counter\".\n   2. More generally, to increase the amount of something. Example:\n\"Aos the campfire\" means \"Add more wood to the campfire\". Silly.\nAntonym: SOS\n   This word is the name of a PDP-10 instruction that takes any\nmemory location in the computer and adds one to it. AOS means \"Add One\nand do not Skip\". Why, you may ask, does the S stand for \"Do not Skip\"\nrather than \"Skip\"? Ah, here is a beloved piece of PDP-10 folklore.\nThere are eight such instructions: AOSE adds One and then Skips the\nnext instruction if the result is Equal to zero; AOSG adds One and then\nSkips if the result is Greater than zero; AOSN adds One and then Skips\nif the result is Not zero; AOSA adds One and then Skips Always; and so\non. Just plain AOS doesn't say when to skip, so it never skips. For\nsimilar reasons, AOJ means \"Add One and do not Jump\". Even more\nbizarre, SKIP means \"Do not SKIP\"! If you want to skip the next\ninstruction, you must say \"SKIPA\". Likewise, JUMP means \"Do not JUMP\".\n\nARG (ahrg) noun.\n   An argument, in the mathematical sense only: a quantity accepted\nby a function or procedure. Example: \"The sine function takes one arg,\nbut the arc-tangent function can take either one or two args\".\n   This is an abbreviation that has become a new word in its own\nright, just as \"telephone\" and \"pianoforte\" have become \"phone\" and\n\"piano\". Arguments to mathematical functions and computational\nprocedures are discussed so frequently by hackers that this ab-\nbreviation saves a lot of time.\n\nAUTOMAGICALLY (aw'toh-maj'i-k:l-lee, aw'toh-maj'i-klee) adverb.\n   Automatically, but in a way which, for some reason (typically\nbecause it is too complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too\ntrivial), the speaker doesn't feel like explaining. Example: \"File that\nhave a name ending in 'TMP' are automagically deleted when you log\nout\". (This means \"When you say good-bye to the computer, files with\nnames ending in 'TMP' are deleted. How this happens is complicated and\nI don't want to get into it just now. Trust me, it works.\")\n   See MAGIC\n\nBAGBITER (bag'bie-t:r) noun.\n   1. Something, such as a program or a computer, that fails to work\nor that works in a remarkably clumsy manner. Example: \"This text editor\nwon't let me make a file with a line longer than eighty characters!\nWhat a bagbiter!\"\n   2. A person who has caused you some trouble, inadvertently or\notherwise, typically by failing to program the computer properly.\nSynonyms: LOSER, CRETIN, CHOMPER.\n   BAGBITING adjective. Having the quality of a bagbiter. \"This\nbagbiting system won't let me compute the greatest common divisor of\ntwo negative numbers.\"\nSynonyms: LOSING, CRETINOUS, BLETCHEROUS, BARFUCIOUS, CHOMPING.\n   BITE THE BAG verb. To fail in some manner. Example: \"The computer\nkeeps CRASHING every five minutes.\" \"Yes, the disk controller is really\nbiting the bag.\" The original meaning of this term was almost un-\ndoubtedly obscene, probably referring to the scrotum. In its current\nusage it has become almost completely sanitized.\n\nBANG noun.\n   The character \"!\" (exclamation point). Synonyms: EXCL, SHRIEK. See\nCHARACTERS. This term is more popular at CMU than at MIT or Stanford.\nIt is used to describe the character \"!\" itself rather than to replace\nit. For example, one would not say, \"Congratulations bang.\" On the\nother hand, if I wanted you to write \"FOO!\" -- those exact four\ncharacters, on a piece of paper -- I would tell you, \"Write eff, oh,\noh, bang.\"\n\nBAR\n   The second metasyntactic variable, after FOO. If a hacker needs to\ninvent exactly two names for things, he almost always picks the names\n\"foo\" and \"bar\". Example: \"Suppose we have two functions, say, foo and\nbar. Now suppose foo calls bar...\"\n   See FOO, FOOBAR.\n\nBARF\n   1. interjection. Term of disgust or frustration. See BLETCH.\n   2. verb. To say \"Barf!\" or a similar term of disgust (because one\nis annoyed or offended).\n   3. To fail to work because of unacceptable input; sometimes, to\nprint an error message. Examples: \"The division operation barfs if you\ntry to divide by zero.\" (Division by zero fails in some unspecified\nspectacular way) \"The text editor barfs if you try to read in a new\nfile before writing out the old one.\"\n   BARFULOUS, BARFUCIOUS adjective. So ugly or offensive as to make\nsomeone barf.\n   These meanings are derived form the common slang meaning of\n\"barf\", namely, \"to vomit\".\n\nBAZ (baz)\n   1. The third metasyntactic variable, after FOO and BAR.\n   2. interjection. Term of mild annoyance. In this usage the pro-\nnunciation is often drawn out for two or three seconds, sometimes\nsounding like the bleating of a sheep: \"Baaaaaaaaaaz!\"\n\nBELLS AND WHISTLES noun.\n   Unnecessary (but often useful, convenient, or amusing) features of\na program or other object. Example: \"Now that we've got the basic\nprogram working, let's go back and add some bells and whistles.\"\nOn an automobile, things like power windows and quadrophonic sound\nwould be bells and whistles.\n   This term is widely used, and not just in the hacker community. To\nunderstand it, think of a plain box that does a job well but is awfully\nboring to look at. Who will buy it? Now you add a few bells and\nwhistles. They don't do anything useful, but they make the product more\ninteresting. Nobody seems to know what distinguishes a bell from a\nwhistle.\n\nBIGNUM (big'num) noun.\n   1. A multiple-precision computer representation for very large\ninteger.\n   2. More generally, any very large number. \"Have you ever looked at\nthe United States Budget? There's bignums for you!\"\n   3. When playing backgammon, large numbers on the dice, especially\na roll of double fives or double sixes.\nSee EL CAMINO BIGNUM.\n   Most computer languages provide a kind of data called \"integers\",\nbut such computer integers are usually very limited in size; usually\nthey must be smaller than 215 (32768) or 231 (2147483648).

    "content": "In some ecclesial contexts, plans and proposals for blessings of unions of persons of the same sex are being advanced. Such projects are not infrequently motivated by a sincere desire to welcome and accompany homosexual persons, to whom are proposed paths of growth in faith, “so that those who manifest a homosexual orientation can receive the assistance they need to understand and fully carry out God’s will in their lives”[1].\n\nOn such paths, listening to the word of God, prayer, participation in ecclesial liturgical actions and the exercise of charity can play an important role in sustaining the commitment to read one's own history and to adhere with freedom and responsibility to one's baptismal call, because “God loves every person and the Church does the same”[2], rejecting all unjust discrimination.\n\nAmong the liturgical actions of the Church, the sacramentals have a singular importance: “These are sacred signs that resemble the sacraments: they signify effects, particularly of a spiritual kind, which are obtained through the Church’s intercession. By them men are disposed to receive the chief effect of the sacraments, and various occasions of life are sanctified”[3]. The Catechism of the Catholic Church specifies, then, that “sacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the way that the sacraments do, but by the Church’s prayer, they prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it” (#1670).\n\nBlessings belong to the category of the sacramentals, whereby the Church “calls us to praise God, encourages us to implore his protection, and exhorts us to seek his mercy by our holiness of life”[4]. In addition, they “have been established as a kind of imitation of the sacraments, blessings are signs above all of spiritual effects that are achieved through the Church’s intercession”[5].\n\nConsequently, in order to conform with the nature of sacramentals, when a blessing is invoked on particular human relationships, in addition to the right intention of those who participate, it is necessary that what is blessed be objectively and positively ordered to receive and express grace, according to the designs of God inscribed in creation, and fully revealed by Christ the Lord. Therefore, only those realities which are in themselves ordered to serve those ends are congruent with the essence of the blessing imparted by the Church.\n\nFor this reason, it is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage (i.e., outside the indissoluble union of a man and a woman open in itself to the transmission of life), as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex[6]. The presence in such relationships of positive elements, which are in themselves to be valued and appreciated, cannot justify these relationships and render them legitimate objects of an ecclesial blessing, since the positive elements exist within the context of a union not ordered to the Creator’s plan.\n\nFurthermore, since blessings on persons are in relationship with the sacraments, the blessing of homosexual unions cannot be considered licit. This is because they would constitute a certain imitation or analogue of the nuptial blessing[7] invoked on the man and woman united in the sacrament of Matrimony, while in fact “there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family”[8].\n\nThe declaration of the unlawfulness of blessings of unions between persons of the same sex is not therefore, and is not intended to be, a form of unjust discrimination, but rather a reminder of the truth of the liturgical rite and of the very nature of the sacramentals, as the Church understands them.\n\nThe Christian community and its Pastors are called to welcome with respect and sensitivity persons with homosexual inclinations, and will know how to find the most appropriate ways, consistent with Church teaching, to proclaim to them the Gospel in its fullness. At the same time, they should recognize the genuine nearness of the Church – which prays for them, accompanies them and shares their journey of Christian faith[9] – and receive the teachings with sincere openness.\n\nThe answer to the proposed dubium does not preclude the blessings given to individual persons with homosexual inclinations[10], who manifest the will to live in fidelity to the revealed plans of God as proposed by Church teaching. Rather, it declares illicit any form of blessing that tends to acknowledge their unions as such. In this case, in fact, the blessing would manifest not the intention to entrust such individual persons to the protection and help of God, in the sense mentioned above, but to approve and encourage a choice and a way of life that cannot be recognized as objectively ordered to the revealed plans of God[11].\n\nAt the same time, the Church recalls that God Himself never ceases to bless each of His pilgrim children in this world, because for Him “we are more important to God than all of the sins that we can commit”[12]. But he does not and cannot bless sin: he blesses sinful man, so that he may recognize that he is part of his plan of love and allow himself to be changed by him. He in fact “takes us as we are, but never leaves us as we are”[13].\n\nFor the above mentioned reasons, the Church does not have, and cannot have, the power to bless unions of persons of the same sex in the sense intended above.\n\nThe Sovereign Pontiff Francis, at the Audience granted to the undersigned Secretary of this Congregation, was informed and gave his assent to the publication of the above-mentioned Responsum ad dubium, with the annexed Explanatory Note.\n\nRome, from the Offices of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the 22nd of February 2021, Feast of the Chair of Saint Peter, Apostle.\n\nLuis F.

    "content": "Butcheries and bakeries are supposed to be closed under level four restrictions, but some suppliers of halal meats, like Auckland butcher Shafeel Khan, say their customers can't buy from anywhere else.\n\nMr Khan says he told his customers not to stock up before the lockdown as he was sure he would be classed as an essential business, but he’s now having to turn them away after a visit from police.\n\n“Yesterday around 1pm a police officer came and notified me all butchers are classified as non-essential, I’d have to close down immediately,” Mr Khan said.\n\n“He felt very saddened he had to come and close me down… basically what he said to me was that I had to serve the last few customers and close up the shop until further notice.”\n\nCountdown says it does not sell halal-certified meat and Kiwi Muslims 1 NEWS spoke to say there is very little available at other supermarkets.\n\nSome also say there’s no guarantee that supermarket halal meat is 100 per cent halal because it is stored and transported alongside non-halal products.\n\nAuckland shopper Sister Jannah Pritchard says Kiwi Muslims are too wary to buy meat from supermarkets, even if it was available.\n\n“A lot of brothers and sisters in my Muslim community, they won't buy from big chain stores, they want to buy from places that are purely halal,\" she said.\n\nAnother would-be customer, Imraan Ali says it’s particularly important for Kiwis to access halal meat in the lead up to the holy month of Ramadan, which starts on April 23rd in New Zealand.\n\n“The lockdown could extend, we're going into month of Ramadan which will make it more difficult for the Muslim community,” Mr Ali said.\n\n“I’ve been in West Auckland for 25 years and have never purchased meat at the supermarket, the reason for that is we know it's 100 per cent halal here (at this butcher).\n\n\"There’s no risk of food contamination with non-halal food, that’s a really critical part of our beliefs.”\n\nAccording to the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, the only meat devout Muslims can consume from New Zealand supermarkets is fish.\n\nIt says under Islamic law, the following rules apply for meat to be considered halal\n\n- That the animal has been killed with a sharp knife\n- That it’s throat is cut ensuring the severance of the oesophagus and the jugular veins.\n- That only Allah’s name is mentioned at the time of the slaughtering and no other name is associated.\n- Shaimud Khan runs one of only two halal butcheries in the Wellington region, and his is the only one that remains open during the lockdown.\n\nHe says he’s been closed for the last two days, but opened today for phone orders because of overwhelming customer demand.\n\n“The only reason we opened today was because of the demand from the local Muslim community, particularly refugees and people who have recently migrated,” Mr Khan said.\n\nHe says he’s applied to be considered as an essential business, but will close if he’s visited by police.\n\n“We are strictly on a phone order basis only so people have to pre-order before they come in and they just come in, they collect and they leave.\n\n\"There’s very minimal interaction between people and staff and customers.”\n\nHe said the provision of halal meats isn’t just important for Muslims.\n\n“It’s important not just for Muslims but for the Jewish community as well as a lot of orthodox Christians, they only eat halal meat so that’s why it’s important for us to stay open.”\n\nThe Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment says it’s looking into halal butcheries.\n\n“The Government has been closely monitoring how the Essential Services requirements have been operating since they were introduced and we have been listening to feedback and making changes as we go where necessary,” an MBIE spokesperson told 1 News.\n\n“We signalled from the beginning that what constitutes an essential service or business may change during this period of shutdown.”\n\nA Countdown spokesperson told 1 NEWS while the supermarket doesn’t sell halal certified meat, it’s in talks with the Ministry for Primary Industries about how it can help.\n\n“We’re really aware of how difficult it must be for customers seeking halal-certified meat during the lockdown.”\n\n“There are some really significant challenges for any supermarket to overcome to ensure the integrity of halal is maintained end-to-end throughout the supply chain and in stores.”\n\nIn her daily press conference yesterday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was important for small businesses to stick to the rules.\n\n“I know this is a very difficult time for small businesses our butchers, our bakers, our grocers, they are providing, generally, food services for their community, but if every single one of them opened up across the country, it defeats the point,\" she said.\n\n\"It opens up a huge chain of transmission, so I’m asking them to do right by their communities, and to close.”\n\nFoodstuffs didn’t respond to request for comment.",

    "content": "Talk about leading from behind: The Federal Aviation Administration waited until 51 other countries’ air safety regulators barred flights by Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft before announcing Wednesday that it too would ground the planes indefinitely.\n\nWell, technically, the FAA didn’t announce the move. President Trump did, at an impromptu news conference at the White House on Wednesday. It’s not clear what role, if any, Trump played in the FAA’s decision to issue the emergency order; the order itself says the agency received new information Wednesday that prompted the move.\n\nThe agency was expressing confidence in the 737 Max planes as late as Tuesday evening, three days after a second devastating crash within five months involving a freshly minted 737 Max 8. What finally prompted the FAA to act, according to the agency, was “new information from the wreckage” of the second plane and satellite tracking data that indicated “the possibility of a shared cause for the two incidents that needs to be better understood and addressed.”\n\nIt’s not clear what role, if any, Trump played in the FAA’s decision to issue the emergency order.Most other countries evidently felt it was bad enough that two new planes of the same model would crash shortly after takeoff in the clear light of day, one near Indonesia last November and the second in Ethiopia on Sunday. After the first crash, Boeing warned airlines that a new stabilizing system on the plane meant to detect and respond to a dangerous loss of lift could, under some conditions, improperly send the aircraft into a dive. It also planned a software update to address the problem. Then the second crash happened, causing some to worry that the sensor malfunction had claimed both planes.\n\nAs it happens, a number of pilots filed complaints with U.S. authorities about the stabilizing system and what they say was the insufficient training provided for it. The FAA may not have reviewed those complaints, however, because the complaint database is maintained by a different agency.\n\nIt’s easy to criticize the FAA’s actions with the luxury of hindsight. What’s key for public confidence and public safety, though, is that the agency strike the right balance between two important but sometimes competing wishes: that its decisions be based on solid data and scientific analysis, not emotion or political influence, and that vulnerable travelers be protected against potentially fatal risks. In addition, any move to ground planes throws a monkey wrench into the transportation system, potentially preventing airlines from providing all the flights they’ve committed to making.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that air travel is, statistically, much safer than other modes of transportation. That’s especially true in the United States, which is a testament to both the industry and its regulators here.\n\nTo help preserve public confidence in those regulators, it’s important for Congress to examine why the FAA decided not to ground the 737 Max planes until after the software update was completed (reportedly next month), and why it suddenly changed its mind Wednesday. The latter was the right move, but was it made for the right reasons?Trump’s own comments were, as usual, less than reassuring. “I didn’t want to take any chances,” he said, but added, “We didn’t have to make this decision today. We could have delayed it. We maybe didn’t have to make it at all. But I felt it was important both psychologically and a lot of other ways.”\n\nThe president isn’t exactly watching from the sidelines on this issue. He spoke to Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg by phone Tuesday, and Muilenburg reportedly lobbied against grounding the planes. Trump also has pitched Boeing’s products to foreign leaders; while in Vietnam to negotiate with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, Trump witnessed a deal by two Vietnamese airlines to buy $15.7 billion worth of Boeing jets, including 100 737 Max models.\n\nDid a president notorious for governing by gut instinct push the FAA one way or another on how to handle the 737 Max crashes? That’s another issue Congress should explore.",

    "content": "Pope Francis held the special Urbi et Orbi on Friday from the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nUsually a colorful event reserved only for Christmas Day and Easter Sunday, this extraordinary blessing was held in keeping with the gravity of the current global situation, as more than half of the world’s population is confined to their homes to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nStanding in a deserted St. Peter’s Square with a steady rain falling, Pope Francis spoke to the world through all the means of modern communication: Facebook, YouTube, TV, and radio.\n\nSymbols of faith\nHe prayed for the world at this critical juncture in the presence of two images that have accompanied the people of Rome for centuries: the ancient icon of Mary Salus Populi Romani – usually housed in the Basilica of St. Mary Major – and the miraculous crucifix kept in the church of San Marcello on the city’s Via del Corso.\n\nMost importantly, the Pope exposed the Blessed Sacrament for adoration and imparted his Apostolic Blessing, offering everyone the opportunity to receive a plenary indulgence.Evening meditation\nBut first, Pope Francis offered a meditation on the crisis facing the world, reflecting on a passage from the Gospel of Mark (4:35-41).\n\n“For weeks now it has been evening,” said the Pope. “Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities; it has taken over our lives, filling everything with a deafening silence and a distressing void, that stops everything as it passes by; we feel it in the air, we notice it in people’s gestures, their glances give them away.”\n\nIn this situation, he said, we feel afraid and lost, like the disciples whose boat was in danger of sinking while Jesus slept at the stern.\n\nAll in the same boat\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has reminded us that we are all on the same boat, said Pope Francis, and so we call out to Jesus. The disciples ask Him, “Teacher, do you not care if we perish?”\n\nThe Pope said these words would have shaken Jesus, “because He, more than anyone, cares about us.”\n\nThe storm, said the Pope, exposes “our vulnerability and uncovers those false and superfluous certainties around which we have constructed our daily schedules” and lays bare “all those attempts to anesthetize ourselves”.\n\nWhat is revealed, he said, is “our belonging as brothers and sisters”, our common humanity.\n\n“Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?\nPope Francis then picked up the thread of Jesus’ question: “Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?”\n\nHe said we have all gone ahead “at breakneck speed”, ignoring the wars, injustice, and cries of the poor and our ailing planet. “We carried on regardless, thinking we would stay healthy in a world that was sick.”\n\nIn our stormy sea, we now cry out: “Wake up, Lord!”Now is the time of choosing\nReally, said Pope Francis, it is Jesus calling out to us to be converted, calling us to faith.\n\n“You are calling on us to seize this time of trial as a time of choosing,” he said.\n\nNow is not the time of God’s judgment, but of our own: “a time to choose what matters and what passes away, a time to separate what is necessary from what is not.”\n\nThe Pope said we can draw lessons from the many people who – even though fearful – have reacted by giving their lives, including medical personnel, supermarket clerks, cleaners, priests, police officers, and volunteers. This, he said, “is the force of the Spirit poured out and fashioned in courageous and generous self-denial.”\n\nStripped of our self-sufficiency\nPope Francis said faith begins “when we realize we are in need of salvation” and are not self-sufficient.\n\nIf we turn to Jesus and hand Him our fears, said the Pope, He will conquer them.\n\n“Because this is God’s strength: turning to the good everything that happens to us, even the bad things. He brings serenity into our storms, because with God life never dies.”\n\nSo God asks us now, in the midst of the tempest, “to reawaken and put into practice that solidarity and hope capable of giving strength, support and meaning to these hours when everything seems to be floundering.”\n\nHis cross is our hope\nJesus’ cross, said Pope Francis, is the anchor that has saved us, the rudder that has redeemed us, and our hope, because “by His cross we have been healed and embraced so that nothing and no one can separate us from His redeeming love.”\n\n“In the midst of isolation when we are suffering from a lack of tenderness and chances to meet up, and we experience the loss of so many things,” he said, “let us once again listen to the proclamation that saves us: He is risen and is living by our side.”\n\nSo we embrace His cross in the hardships of the present time, and make room in our hearts “for the creativity that only the Spirit is capable of inspiring.”\n\n“Embracing the Lord in order to embrace hope: that is the strength of faith, which frees us from fear and gives us hope.”\n\nTurning to the Lord\nConcluding his meditation, Pope Francis entrusted us all to the Lord, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, so that our faith might not waiver in this time of crisis.\n\n“Dear brothers and sisters, from this place that tells of Peter’s rock-solid faith, I would like this evening to entrust all of you to the Lord, through the intercession of Mary, Health of the People and Star of the stormy Sea. From this colonnade that embraces Rome and the whole world, may God’s blessing come down upon you as a consoling embrace. Lord, may you bless the world, give health to our bodies and comfort our hearts. You ask us not to be afraid. Yet our faith is weak and we are fearful. But you, Lord, will not leave us at the mercy of the storm. Tell us again: ‘Do not be afraid’ (Mt 28:5). And we, together with Peter, ‘cast all our anxieties onto you, for you care about us’ (cf. 1Pet 5:7).”",

    "content": "Politicians, economists and even some natural scientists have tended to assume that tipping points1 in the Earth system — such as the loss of the Amazon rainforest or the West Antarctic ice sheet — are of low probability and little understood. Yet evidence is mounting that these events could be more likely than was thought, have high impacts and are interconnected across different biophysical systems, potentially committing the world to long-term irreversible changes.\n\nHere we summarize evidence on the threat of exceeding tipping points, identify knowledge gaps and suggest how these should be plugged. We explore the effects of such large-scale changes, how quickly they might unfold and whether we still have any control over them.\n\nIn our view, the consideration of tipping points helps to define that we are in a climate emergency and strengthens this year’s chorus of calls for urgent climate action — from schoolchildren to scientists, cities and countries.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) introduced the idea of tipping points two decades ago. At that time, these ‘large-scale discontinuities’ in the climate system were considered likely only if global warming exceeded 5 °C above pre-industrial levels. Information summarized in the two most recent IPCC Special Reports (published in 2018 and in September this year)2,3 suggests that tipping points could be exceeded even between 1 and 2 °C of warming (see ‘Too close for comfort’).\n\n\nSource: IPCC and J. B. Smith et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 106, 4133-4137 (2009)\n\nIf current national pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions are implemented — and that’s a big ‘if’ — they are likely to result in at least 3 °C of global warming. This is despite the goal of the 2015 Paris agreement to limit warming to well below 2 °C. Some economists, assuming that climate tipping points are of very low probability (even if they would be catastrophic), have suggested that 3 °C warming is optimal from a cost–benefit perspective. However, if tipping points are looking more likely, then the ‘optimal policy’ recommendation of simple cost–benefit climate-economy models4 aligns with those of the recent IPCC report2. In other words, warming must be limited to 1.5 °C. This requires an emergency response.\n\nIce collapse\nWe think that several cryosphere tipping points are dangerously close, but mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions could still slow down the inevitable accumulation of impacts and help us to adapt.\n\nResearch in the past decade has shown that the Amundsen Sea embayment of West Antarctica might have passed a tipping point3: the ‘grounding line’ where ice, ocean and bedrock meet is retreating irreversibly. A model study shows5 that when this sector collapses, it could destabilize the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet like toppling dominoes — leading to about 3 metres of sea-level rise on a timescale of centuries to millennia. Palaeo-evidence shows that such widespread collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet has occurred repeatedly in the past.\n\nThe latest data show that part of the East Antarctic ice sheet — the Wilkes Basin — might be similarly unstable3. Modelling work suggests that it could add another 3–4 m to sea level on timescales beyond a century.\n\nThe Greenland ice sheet is melting at an accelerating rate3. It could add a further 7 m to sea level over thousands of years if it passes a particular threshold. Beyond that, as the elevation of the ice sheet lowers, it melts further, exposing the surface to ever-warmer air. Models suggest that the Greenland ice sheet could be doomed at 1.5 °C of warming3, which could happen as soon as 2030.\n\nThus, we might already have committed future generations to living with sea-level rises of around 10 m over thousands of years3. But that timescale is still under our control. The rate of melting depends on the magnitude of warming above the tipping point. At 1.5 °C, it could take 10,000 years to unfold3; above 2 °C it could take less than 1,000 years6. Researchers need more observational data to establish whether ice sheets are reaching a tipping point, and require better models constrained by past and present data to resolve how soon and how fast the ice sheets could collapse.\n\nWhatever those data show, action must be taken to slow sea-level rise. This will aid adaptation, including the eventual resettling of large, low-lying population centres.\n\nA further key impetus to limit warming to 1.5 °C is that other tipping points could be triggered at low levels of global warming. The latest IPCC models projected a cluster of abrupt shifts7 between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, several of which involve sea ice. This ice is already shrinking rapidly in the Arctic, indicating that, at 2 °C of warming, the region has a 10–35% chance3 of becoming largely ice-free in summer.\n\nBiosphere boundaries\nClimate change and other human activities risk triggering biosphere tipping points across a range of ecosystems and scales (see ‘Raising the alarm’).\n\n\nSource: T. M. Lenton et al.\n\nOcean heatwaves have led to mass coral bleaching and to the loss of half of the shallow-water corals on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. A staggering 99% of tropical corals are projected2 to be lost if global average temperature rises by 2 °C, owing to interactions between warming, ocean acidification and pollution. This would represent a profound loss of marine biodiversity and human livelihoods.\n\nAs well as undermining our life-support system, biosphere tipping points can trigger abrupt carbon release back to the atmosphere. This can amplify climate change and reduce remaining emission budgets.\n\nDeforestation and climate change are destabilizing the Amazon — the world’s largest rainforest, which is home to one in ten known species. Estimates of where an Amazon tipping point could lie range from 40% deforestation to just 20% forest-cover loss8. About 17% has been lost since 1970. The rate of deforestation varies with changes in policy. Finding the tipping point requires models that include deforestation and climate change as interacting drivers, and that incorporate fire and climate feedbacks as interacting tipping mechanisms across scales.\n\nWith the Arctic warming at least twice as quickly as the global average, the boreal forest in the subarctic is increasingly vulnerable. Already, warming has triggered large-scale insect disturbances and an increase in fires that have led to dieback of North American boreal forests, potentially turning some regions from a carbon sink to a carbon source9. Permafrost across the Arctic is beginning to irreversibly thaw and release carbon dioxide and methane — a greenhouse gas that is around 30 times more potent than CO2 over a 100-year period.\n\nResearchers need to improve their understanding of these observed changes in major ecosystems, as well as where future tipping points might lie. Existing carbon stores and potential releases of CO2 and methane need better quantification.\n\nThe world’s remaining emissions budget for a 50:50 chance of staying within 1.5 °C of warming is only about 500 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2. Permafrost emissions could take an estimated 20% (100 Gt CO2) off this budget10, and that’s without including methane from deep permafrost or undersea hydrates. If forests are close to tipping points, Amazon dieback could release another 90 Gt CO2 and boreal forests a further 110 Gt CO211. With global total CO2 emissions still at more than 40 Gt per year, the remaining budget could be all but erased already.\n\nA diver observes major bleaching on the coral reefs of Society Islands, French Polynesia.\nBleached corals on a reef near the island of Moorea in French Polynesia in the South Pacific.Credit: Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty\n\nGlobal cascade\nIn our view, the clearest emergency would be if we were approaching a global cascade of tipping points that led to a new, less habitable, ‘hothouse’ climate state11. Interactions could happen through ocean and atmospheric circulation or through feedbacks that increase greenhouse-gas levels and global temperature. Alternatively, strong cloud feedbacks could cause a global tipping point12,13.\n\nWe argue that cascading effects might be common. Research last year14 analysed 30 types of regime shift spanning physical climate and ecological systems, from collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet to a switch from rainforest to savanna. This indicated that exceeding tipping points in one system can increase the risk of crossing them in others. Such links were found for 45% of possible interactions14.\n\nIn our view, examples are starting to be observed. For example, Arctic sea-ice loss is amplifying regional warming, and Arctic warming and Greenland melting are driving an influx of fresh water into the North Atlantic. This could have contributed to a 15% slowdown15 since the mid-twentieth century of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) , a key part of global heat and salt transport by the ocean3. Rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet and further slowdown of the AMOC could destabilize the West African monsoon, triggering drought in Africa’s Sahel region. A slowdown in the AMOC could also dry the Amazon, disrupt the East Asian monsoon and cause heat to build up in the Southern Ocean, which could accelerate Antarctic ice loss.\n\nThe palaeo-record shows global tipping, such as the entry into ice-age cycles 2.6 million years ago and their switch in amplitude and frequency around one million years ago, which models are only just capable of simulating. Regional tipping occurred repeatedly within and at the end of the last ice age, between 80,000 and 10,000 years ago (the Dansgaard–Oeschger and Heinrich events). Although this is not directly applicable to the present interglacial period, it highlights that the Earth system has been unstable across multiple timescales before, under relatively weak forcing caused by changes in Earth’s orbit. Now we are strongly forcing the system, with atmospheric CO2 concentration and global temperature increasing at rates that are an order of magnitude higher than those during the most recent deglaciation.\n\nAtmospheric CO2 is already at levels last seen around four million years ago, in the Pliocene epoch. It is rapidly heading towards levels last seen some 50 million years ago — in the Eocene — when temperatures were up to 14 °C higher than they were in pre-industrial times. It is challenging for climate models to simulate such past ‘hothouse’ Earth states. One possible explanation is that the models have been missing a key tipping point: a cloud-resolving model published this year suggests that the abrupt break-up of stratocumulus cloud above about 1,200 parts per million of CO2 could have resulted in roughly 8 °C of global warming12.\n\nSome early results from the latest climate models — run for the IPCC’s sixth assessment report, due in 2021 — indicate a much larger climate sensitivity (defined as the temperature response to doubling of atmospheric CO2) than in previous models. Many more results are pending and further investigation is required, but to us, these preliminary results hint that a global tipping point is possible.\n\nTo address these issues, we need models that capture a richer suite of couplings and feedbacks in the Earth system, and we need more data — present and past — and better ways to use them. Improving the ability of models to capture known past abrupt climate changes and ‘hothouse’ climate states should increase confidence in their ability to forecast these.\n\nSome scientists counter that the possibility of global tipping remains highly speculative. It is our position that, given its huge impact and irreversible nature, any serious risk assessment must consider the evidence, however limited our understanding might still be. To err on the side of danger is not a responsible option.\n\nIf damaging tipping cascades can occur and a global tipping point cannot be ruled out, then this is an existential threat to civilization. No amount of economic cost–benefit analysis is going to help us. We need to change our approach to the climate problem.\n\nAct now\nIn our view, the evidence from tipping points alone suggests that we are in a state of planetary emergency: both the risk and urgency of the situation are acute (see ‘Emergency: do the maths’).\n\nEMERGENCY: DO THE MATHS\nWe define emergency (E) as the product of risk and urgency. Risk (R) is defined by insurers as probability (p) multiplied by damage (D). Urgency (U) is defined in emergency situations as reaction time to an alert (τ) divided by the intervention time left to avoid a bad outcome (T). Thus:\n\nE = R × U = p × D × τ / T\n\nThe situation is an emergency if both risk and urgency are high. If reaction time is longer than the intervention time left (τ / T > 1), we have lost control.\n\nWe argue that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at best. Hence we might already have lost control of whether tipping happens. A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping — and hence the risk posed — could still be under our control to some extent.\n\nThe stability and resilience of our planet is in peril. International action — not just words — must reflect this.\n\nNature 575, 592-595 (2019)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03595-0\n\nUPDATES & CORRECTIONS\nCorrection 09 April 2020: The figure ‘Too close for comfort’ in this Comment incorrectly synthesized and interpreted data from the IPCC.

Martin Luther King, Jr., told \"Fox & Friends\" Sunday she was planning to attend service in person with precautions and urged her fellow Americans, \"Don't panic. Pray.\"For smaller, local churches, pastors face hard decisions about continuing to hold services and maintaining the bonds of community, as public health officials urge canceling events larger than 50 people.\n\nAt St. Philip African Methodist Episcopal Church in Atlanta, about 100 congregants dotted a sanctuary built for thousands. Rev. William Watley told members he would follow official directives on whether to hold church services after Sunday.“Some of the younger preachers said, ‘You going to have church?’ When you think about some of the mess that all of us have been through, the possibility of coronavirus. ... It’s going to take more than this to stop us from serving and trusting God,\" Watley said. \"His steadfast love endures!”\n\nHe quickly added: “You do your part. You wash your hands like you got sense.”The unique opportunity offered many churches a chance to broaden their audience.\n\n\"Over 300 salvations through Woodlands Church’s online services this weekend,\" Christian author Lee Strobel tweeted. \"Thank God! Praying that this medical crisis sparks a revival!\"Religious leaders took unprecedented action over the weekend to accommodate the faithful.\n\nFor Roman Catholics, where attendance at Mass is considered a sacred obligation, many bishops -- including all those in Pennsylvania and Ohio — said they were temporarily dispensing with the requirement that parishioners attend Mass.“A general dispensation is given from the Sunday and Holy Day obligation,” the Utah bishop, Oscar Solis, announced. ”Catholics are asked to pray at home, with the rosary, biblical prayer, personal devotions and/or to devoutly watch televised Masses.\"\n\nComparably strong measures were taken by leaders of many other faiths, ranging from Orthodox Jewish rabbis in New Jersey to Episcopal and United Methodist bishops in North Carolina.\n\nFrom its headquarters in Salt Lake City, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church, announced it is halting all worship services and church activities for its 16 million members worldwide.\n\nHoly Week will look very different for millions of Christians across the globe.The Vatican has already announced all public Masses in Italy are forbidden, and with Easter, April 12, quickly approaching, it appears the measures put in place by the Italian government could extend beyond April 3.\n\nPope Francis left the Vatican Sunday to visit St. Mary Major Basilica near Rome's central train station, where he reportedly prayed to the Virgin Mary for the sick.More than 6,470 people worldwide have died in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with at least 64 in the United States.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

    "content": "The Treasury Laws Amendment (News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) Act 2021 (the code) is a mandatory code of conduct which governs commercial relationships between Australian news businesses and ‘designated’ digital platforms who benefit from a significant bargaining power imbalance.\n\nThe ACCC considers that addressing this imbalance is necessary to support the sustainability of the Australian news media sector, which is essential to a well-functioning democracy.\n\nHow it works\nThe code, which focuses on online content, came into effect on 2 March 2021 and will be reviewed by Australia’s Treasury in 2022 to ensure it remains fit for purpose.\n\nUnder the legislation, the Treasurer is able to designate certain digital platforms as subject to the obligations under the code. No digital platforms have yet been designated, but this has not affected the effectiveness of the code.\n\nIn deciding whether to designate a digital platform, the Treasurer must consider whether there is a significant bargaining power imbalance between the platform corporation and Australian news businesses, and also whether the platform corporation has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry, including through agreements to remunerate those businesses for their news content.\n\nThe effect of the code\nWhile the Treasurer has not designated any digital platforms or services to date, the ACCC considers that existence of the code and the threat of designation is having the appropriate and hoped for impact. \n\nFollowing the introduction of the code, Google and Facebook (now Meta) have reached voluntary commercial deals with a significant number of news media organisations. They have also implemented other voluntary initiatives to support journalism in Australia, such as Google’s ‘Digital News Academy’ and Meta’s ‘Journalism Accelerator Project’.\n\nThe details of these commercial deals are not required to be released and the ACCC does not have a formal role in monitoring the outcomes. However, the ACCC understands at least 30 agreements have been reached with a range of media organisations, including small and regional publications.\n\nThe ACCC has separately authorised both Country Press Australia on 5 August 2021, and Commercial Radio Australia on 29 October 2021, to collectively bargain with each of Google and Facebook for remuneration for news content featured on those platforms without breaching Australian competition laws. \n\nThe ACCC has similarly published 2 collective bargaining class exemption notices lodged by the Minderoo Foundation on 24 January 2022 on behalf of 23 small publishers which allows them to collectively bargain with each of Google and Meta for remuneration for news content featured on those platforms without breaching Australian competition laws.\n\nPublic reports suggest that, in total, these deals with Google and Meta total several hundreds of millions of dollars per annum and have resulted in strong hiring environments for Australian journalists. Significant Australian news businesses have also committed to increase investment in journalism and regional news.\n\nBackground\nOn 20 April 2020, the Australian Government asked the ACCC to develop a mandatory code of conduct to address bargaining power imbalances between Australian news media businesses and digital platforms, specifically Google and Facebook.\n\nOn 31 July 2020 the ACCC released a draft code for public consultation and a series of questions and answers (Q&As) about the draft code.\n\nFollowing consultation, the ACCC made recommendations to Government based on the views put forward by stakeholders. Government has now considered these recommendations and developed its final legislation.\n\nThe final legislation as passed by both houses on 25 February 2021 is available on the Federal Register of Legislation.\n\nA joint media release from the Treasurer and the Minister for Communications, published on 25 February 2021, is available on the Treasury Portfolio Ministers website.",

    "content": "(CNN) -- Deadly clashes erupted this week between Moroccan forces and local rebels in Western Sahara -- a long-disputed region of northwestern Africa.\n\nThe violence coincided with a round of talks -- informally backed by the United Nations -- between Morocco and representatives of Polisario Front, the region's independence movement.\n\nPolisario said Moroccan authorities raided a camp on Monday in Western Sahara, leaving 19 people dead, 723 wounded, and 159 missing, and the group said the fighting has continued since then. Morocco's official news agency said eight Moroccan police officers also died in the raid.\n\nAhmed Boukhari, a Polisario representative, told CNN in an e-mail Tuesday that \"the tragic events\" were \"the result of a deliberate act carried out by Morocco to undermine the current U.N. peace process.\"\n\nMorocco annexed the territory in the mid-1970s after Spain gave up control, and guerrilla warfare with the Polisario -- which favors independence for the region -- ensued until a U.N.-brokered cease-fire ended the violence in 1991.\n\nMorocco is offering an autonomy proposal for the territory, which would maintain Moroccan sovereignty but allow for some local administration. Polisario says the final status should be determined by a popular referendum that includes the option of independence.\n\nAs for the Monday violence, the Polisario said Moroccan forces stormed a camp where approximately 20,000 Saharawis, or Western Sahara residents, have spent a month protesting what it says is the \"lack of employment opportunities and discrimination under the Moroccan occupation.\"\n\nMorocco's news agency, MAP, said the security forces' operation was designed to \"set free old people, women and children who were under the grip of individuals with criminal records and wanted for common law crimes in the camp of Gdim Izik.\"\n\nThe third round of the U.N.-backed talks ended this week, with both sides agreeing to continue discussions in December and early next year.\n\nThe meetings took place in the New York City area at the invitation of Christopher Ross, the U.N. secretary-general's personal envoy for Western Sahara.\n\nA communique issued at the end of talks Tuesday night said there were \"broad and frank\" discussions of each side's proposals, but \"each party continues to reject the proposal of the other as a basis for future negotiations,\" the United Nations said Wednesday.\n\nThe communique cited confidence-building measures, such as flights aimed at connecting Sahrawi refugees living in camps in Algeria's Tindouf region with their relatives in Western Sahara.\n\nThe neighboring countries of Algeria and Mauritania are also involved in the discussions about the territory.",

Millions of videos have been removed from view as a result of the new policy.\n\nPornhub also claims it is being targeted by organisations that want to abolish pornography, rather than being assessed on its merits.'Because we are an adult platform'\nThe latest move builds on Pornhub's previous efforts to tackle the controversy sparked by the New York Times article.\n\nThe site says it has \"suspended\" the videos it has taken offline, rather than describing them as deleted.\n\nPornhub says it plans to introduce a verification system for regular users in the New Year.\n\n\"This means every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders, a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute,\" the site blogged.\n\n\"It is clear that Pornhub is being targeted not because of our policies and how we compare to our peers, but because we are an adult content platform.\"\n\nIt alleges that groups \"dedicated to abolishing pornography [and] banning material they claim is obscene,\" were behind its problems.\n\nAllegations\nNicholas Kristof's article outlined how the site returned thousands of results for searches for under-age girls, and told the stories of several victims of rape and abuse who had found videos of their assaults online.\n\nIt follows a BBC investigation earlier this year into the case of a woman who discovered the video of her rape as a 14-year-old girl on the site.\n\nKristof's article asked why banks, search engines and card companies support Pornhub, given his allegations - and named Mastercard as one example.\n\nMastercard launched an investigation, and decided to cut ties with Pornhub soon after. Visa is pursuing a similar inquiry.\n\nThe move may have a significant impact on the company. While it is free to use, Pornhub charges £9.99 a month for exclusive content and higher-quality video.\n\nPornhub's parent company MindGeek has previously said the claims were \"irresponsible and flagrantly untrue\".\n\nIn its most recent annual review, Pornhub said it had had 42 billion site visitors in 2019 and more than 6.83 million videos had been uploaded, with a combined viewing time of 169 years. It did not say how many moderators it employed.",

    "content": "Internal conflict in Ethiopia has driven more than 50,000 refugees into Sudan in just over a month, triggering a complex aid operation in an impoverished region of Sudan.\n\nAnd fears of unrest in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region spilling into Sudan were fuelled when several Sudanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday, in what Khartoum called an “ambush” by Ethiopian forces and militias inside its borders.\n\nEthiopian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the incident.\n\nSudan has boosted its military presence near its eastern frontier since the conflict between Ethiopian federal forces and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) started on Nov. 4.\n\nBut forces from Ethiopia’s Amhara ethnic group, which back the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, have also expanded their activity, leading to other incidents in long-disputed farmlands near the border where refugees have been crossing, Sudan’s information minister Faisal Salih told Reuters.\n\n“The tensions increased and some skirmishes took place recently,” he said.\n\nAmhara farmers claim rights to lands in the al-Fashqa plain also claimed by Sudan, and clashes sometimes flare during planting and harvest seasons.\n\nTigrayan refugees now hosted in eastern Sudan hold Amhara forces responsible for much of the violence they fled since early November.\n\nPrompted by security concerns, Sudan’s Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok flew to Ethiopia on Sunday with what senior Sudanese officials said was a proposal to mediate.\n\nEthiopia, which declared victory over the TPLF on Nov. 29, said the offer was unnecessary. The TPLF has said it was continuing to fight.Accounts are difficult to verify because most communications to the region have been down throughout the conflict.\n\nHamdok and Abiy agreed to revive a commission to settle their border dispute, which dates back to colonial times, and made progress over stalled three-way talks with Egypt on a giant hydropower dam Ethiopia has built on the Blue Nile, said Salih.\n\nA diplomatic source in Sudan said Ethiopia’s ambassador had been summoned over the troop deaths on Tuesday, but Abiy struck a conciliatory tone, tweeting: “Such incidents will not break the bond (between) our two countries as we always use dialogue to resolve issues.”\n\nVOLATILE REGION\nSome people in Sudan are concerned that the fighting in Tigray, in which regional diplomats and humanitarian aid workers believe thousands of people have died, poses a threat to a volatile region.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that 950,000 people have been displaced by the crisis tmsnrt.rs/2KEWEmV.\n\n“The conflict area in Ethiopia is a border area, and it’s close to Sudan, Eritrea, and South Sudan. It can impact the whole region, and the Red Sea region,” said Mervat Hamadelnil, head of a Sudanese civil society initiative that has pushed for Sudan to take an active stance on the Tigray war.\n\nSome also worry about the strain that refugee arrivals are placing on Sudan, which is trying to recover from decades of its own internal conflicts that displaced several million people.\n\nAn economic crisis has deepened since the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, causing fuel and bread shortages and pushing inflation to more than 250%.\n\nWhen the first refugees arrived last month, local communities in eastern Sudan welcomed them, residents and officials say.\n\nBut the influx has also pushed up the prices of basic goods, and aid agencies are struggling to source food, water and healthcare for refugees.\n\nSudan’s government has told many civil servants to work from home following a rise in coronavirus cases, complicating logistical operations. The head of Sudan’s refugee commission died from COVID-19 earlier this month.\n\nOne pressure point is that Sudanese authorities, supported by the United Nations, are keen to move refugees quickly away from the border to camps, partly for fear that Tigrayan forces could use Sudan as a rear base, said a staff member of an aid organisation working in the area.\n\nSome refugees are reluctant, hoping to return to Ethiopia to recover relatives, possessions and crops.\n\nThree decades ago, Sudan backed Tigrayan forces that toppled Ethiopia’s Marxist Derg rulers in a conflict that sent previous waves of refugees fleeing west over the border.\n\nSudan’s transitional authorities, grateful for Ethiopia’s mediation between the Sudanese military and civilian groups after Bashir’s overthrow last year, now have no interest in playing a similar role against an Abiy government with international standing, said Suliman Baldo, a policy adviser for The Sentry, a Washington-based research group.\n\n“Sudan needs to be very careful. They cannot afford now to be hosting opposition leaders and opposition armed groups,” he said.",

Her body was found near a shopping centre about 7am that day.Police arrested the man on Friday in the nearby suburb of Greensborough after an extensive investigation into the death of Ms Maasarwe, a Palestinian Arab of Israeli citizenship.\nHermann was on bail at the time of the murder for minor offences.\nIt has been also been revealed today that the breakthrough in this murder investigation came through a local police officer who recognised that distinctive cap and T-shirt left at the crime scene.\nThe officer remembered stopping a man four days earlier wearing those clothes, that led to the quick arrest.The Victorian coroner is also expected to release the body of Ms Maasarwe today.\nMs Maasarwe's body is expected to be given to a funeral director for repatriation.\nHer father, Saeed Maasarwe, had asked for his daughter's body to be released so he could lay her to rest.\n\"(To) take her home for a proper burial and funeral,\" he told The Age, while he attended a tribute in her honour.Her sister Noor Maasarwe had been watching the news when she realised her sister had been found dead in Melbourne.\n\"They didn't say for who it was,\" Ms Maasarwe told Nine News from Israel.\n\"But it matches all the details. It was on the same road. Everything. I was just praying that it's not her. Then I saw the shoes and her phone ... I was sure it was her.\"\nThe Palestine citizen’s death has triggered an outpouring of grief in both Melbourne and her home country of Israel.About 1000 people gathered outside a mosque in the village of West Baqa, calling for the quick return of Ms Maasarwe's body.\n\"The Land Wants Aiia Back,\" read some of the placards, while others called for an end to violence against women across the globe.\nYesterday afternoon, hundreds of people returned to the scene of Ms Maasarwe’s death, joining her father.\nDuring the vigil, Mr Maasarwe stepped forward to grieve his daughter publicly, and thank those who paid tribute.\n“I want to say thank you to all the people in Australia, we appreciate them,” he said.",

    "content": "An historic assault is being waged on the Amazon rainforest and the indigenous people who have called it home for thousands of years as the world’s population takes shelter from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDeforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose more than 50% in the first three months of 2020 compared to the same three-month period last year, according to preliminary satellite data released by the Brazilian Space Agency’s deforestation monitoring system.Even before the pandemic struck, scientists warned that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s development-friendly policies could transform the world’s largest rainforest into a drier, savannah-like landscape. Once this “tipping point” is crossed, scientists said, the ecosystem could begin emitting more greenhouse gases than it captures, effectively turning a vital tool in the fight against climate change into another source of harmful emissions.\n\nBrazil’s indigenous reserves hold some of the most pristine sections of the rainforest in the world and have long been targeted by illegal logging and mining operations seeking to exploit their natural resources. Since the outbreak started, however, Brazil’s environmental agency has scaled back more enforcement measures, leaving the forest and its indigenous tribes even more vulnerable to a litany of deadly threats.\n\n“Our territory keeps being invaded by loggers and hunters,” Laercio Guajajara, a member of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao, told ABC News. Even in the midst of the global health crisis, he said, there were “still a lot of invasions.”\n\nNow, those so-called invaders could leave more than just environmental destruction in their wake.\n\n“We are desperate,” Andre Karipuna, a 27-year-old member of the tiny Karipuna tribe of in the state of Rondonia, told the Environmental Justice Foundation. “The Karipuna are a small isolated community and just one infected person could rapidly pass the virus on to the whole tribe.”\n\nBrazil’s indigenous tribe’s have already been under increased pressure since Bolsonaro took office in 2019. He immediately began slashing funding and enforcement at FUNAI, the country’s department of indigenous affairs that provides essential services to indigenous communities across the nation. In July 2019, he appointed a federal police officer with connections to agribusiness to head the agency.\n\nSome tribal leaders have taken defense of their lands into their own hands. Last summer, ABC News was granted rare access to one such group, the Guajajara tribe’s “Guardians,” embedding within their ragtag convoy of trucks and motorcycles during a four-day patrol over several dozen miles of dense terrain.\n\nWith cameras rolling, the “Guardians” pursued an illegal logging operation deep into the jungle, employing satellite imagery, intelligence gathering and old-fashioned tracking along the way. The resulting documentary, “Guardians of the Amazon” captured a complex struggle, featuring powerful industrial interests, complicit tribal villagers, indifferent government agencies — and an ever-present fear of violent reprisals.Now, in the midst of the pandemic, the Brazilian government is again advancing controversial legislation regarding indigenous lands, potentially compounding tribes' vulnerability to invasion and infection.\n\nIn April, Bolsonaro's indigenous affairs agency, FUNAI, passed the controversial law IN 09. The new rule prevents long-held indigenous lands waiting for official demarcation from being labelled as \"indigenous\" in the land registry as they wait.\n\nEnvironmental groups allege the new law provides a route for those who illegally occupy indigenous lands to claim the land is not indigenous. According to Greenpeace, the seemingly obscure rule change will have drastic consequences for the nearly one third of indigenous lands still awaiting official designation by the government.\n\nAnother controversial rule, Provisional Measure (MP) 910, first decreed by Bolsonaro in December 2019, is now being considered for permanent law. The measure allows those who illegally deforested and occupied protected federal lands before December 2018 to purchase the property at reduced prices.\n\nCritics allege the rule is a reward for illegal land grabbers and criminal gangs who seized protected lands from indigenous tribes, and an analysis by the not-for-profit organization IMAZON found the measure could lead to the added deforestation of up to 16,000 square kilometers of rainforest by 2027.The Bolsonaro administration denies the new land ownership rules would facilitate and legitimize land-grabbing, arguing new landowners will be required to preserve up to 80% of their land and will only grant legal titles to those who occupied federal lands in a “tame and peaceful way for many years.” The measure could be passed by a virtual vote within a few weeks, without being subject to standard scrutiny, according to environmental groups.\n\nSince the enforcement rollbacks, reports of illegal logging and violent attacks across the region’s indigenous reserves have increased. Grave concern is widespread among indigenous tribes both large and small.\n\nIn early April, Indigenous leaders from the Yanomami reserve, the country’s largest, began reporting an increase in illegal gold mining during the pandemic. BBC Brasil published satellite photographs showing illegal miners moving into an area of the reserve where one isolated community lives. Some leaders reportedly blamed the invasions for the April 10th death of a 15-year-old boy who was the first among Yanomami known to die from the virus.\n\nThe Karipuna indigenous tribe of Rondonia -- one of the smallest and most vulnerable indigenous tribes in the country with less than 100 people – submitted a complaint to federal prosecutors on April 8th stating non-indigenous people were clearing inside their reserve.\n\n\"It is urgent that the authorities take surgical and structural measures to combat land grabbing underway [at the reserve]\" the complaint reads, demanding the identification, arrest, and withdrawal of the invaders.Some tribes are reporting an increase in land-use related bloodshed during the pandemic. On April 18th, a 33-year-old indigenous leader of the Uru-eu-wau-wau reserve in Rondonia was reportedly assassinated. The leader had been known for his outspoken criticism of illegal logging.\n\nAnd in March, Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara of the Guajajara tribe in the state of Maranhao was killed by a shotgun-wielding assailant that has yet to be found, according to Amazon Watch. A teacher and longtime supporter of the Guajajara’s “Guardians of the Forest,” Zezico was reportedly gunned down while riding his motorcycle, becoming the fifth Guajajara murdered in as many months.\n\n“Indigenous lands are living a very difficult time,” Erival Guajajara, a 29-year-old member of the Guajajara told ABC News. “We are afraid for our lives because of our vulnerability.”",

    "content": "The Assad regime continues its assaults on the last opposition-held stronghold in Syria’s northwestern Idlib – despite Russia’s announcement of a cease-fire in the area to begin Thursday afternoon – continuing to put at risk the lives of thousands of people and ignoring the calls of the international community, especially Turkey, for peace. The latest announcement marked the third failed cease-fire attempt in the de-escalation zone, resulting mainly from the Bashar Assad regime’s uncompromising stance.\n\nLater on Friday, the Turkish Defense Ministry announced that Turkey and Russia had agreed on a cease-fire in Idlib set to start at midnight on Jan. 12.\n\nTASS news agency had reported Thursday that a cease-fire had been established in Idlib, citing a Russian defense ministry official.\n\n\"According to the agreements with the Turkish side, the cease-fire agreement was introduced in the Idlib de-escalation zone beginning at 2 p.m. Moscow time (11:00 GMT) on Jan. 9, 2020,\" Russian Maj. Gen. Yury Borenkov said.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the alleged cease-fire, the Assad regime launched shelling on Idlib’s southern and southeastern areas, specifically targeting the Maarat al-Numan district and the villages of Maar Shoreen, Talmenes, and Maar Shamshah. The attacks on Maarat al-Numan and Tal Mannis continued Friday.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, in a meeting held in Istanbul between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, both leaders agreed to continue their commitment to “the sovereignty, independence, political unity and territorial integrity of Syria.”\n\nA joint statement by the leaders of the two countries also urged greater humanitarian aid to “all Syrians, without discrimination, politicization or preconditions.”\n\nTurkey had asked Russia previously for a cease-fire in December, sending a delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Önal to Moscow as attacks on the de-escalation zone intensified. The Idlib region has seen an increase in violence in recent weeks as forces loyal to the Assad regime, supported by Russian airstrikes, have launched a fresh assault to capture one of the largest urban centers in the area.\n\nEarlier in August, Damascus scrapped a similar truce agreement only three days after it went into effect, accusing opposition forces and terrorists of targeting a Russian airbase. This move was not surprising since it was already reported by the White Helmets civil defense group during the cease-fire period that at least one civilian had been killed and five had been wounded in Idlib despite the announcement of a cease-fire when Turkey, Russia and Iran, the three guarantors of the Astana peace process, met at the 13th meeting held in Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan. Later, toward the end of August, Assad regime ally Russia announced that the Damascus regime forces would observe a new cease-fire in Idlib. It said the truce aimed \"to stabilize the situation\" in Idlib but the army \"reserves the right to respond to violations\" by terrorists and allied opposition groups, it added. Yet again, the cease-fire was short-lived as a Russian airstrike was launched on a health facility in Aleppo's western countryside under the same pretexts, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported only a few hours before the agreement was to go into effect.\n\nThe Assad regime has repeatedly vowed to take back Idlib, and bombardment has continued despite a cease-fire.\n\nOn Dec. 20, the regime and its allies launched a military campaign primarily in the cities of Maarat al-Numan and Saraqib as well as the surrounding rural areas, capturing 35 residential areas.\n\nThe latest reports reveal that at least 253 people were killed and 250 others were injured in Idlib in December alone. At least 300,000 civilians have fled their homes in southern Idlib since mid-December, following a sharp escalation in hostilities, the U.N. stated last week.\n\nTurkey and Russia agreed in September 2018 to turn Idlib into a de-escalation zone in which acts of aggression are prohibited.\n\nDespite the Sochi deal, the regime, backed by Moscow, intensified its attacks starting on April 26 under the pretext of fighting the al-Qaida-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) terrorists holed up in Idlib. Since then, the situation has worsened, taking more civilian lives with each passing day.",

Chauvin’s guilty verdict set off a wave of relief, but many argued that the country still has a long way to go in achieving racial equality.",

Hall said when he first introduced a vaccine requirement last July, months before Saskatchewan imposed a provincial mandate, he had support from his customers, but also faced a backlash. \n\n\"We were subjected to a barrage of harassment online and by phone … 'We're going to boycott you, we're going to sue you, we're going to find out where you live,'\" said Hall, co-owner of Bodhi Tree Yoga.\n\n\"I'm honestly not sure that I can handle another round of anti-vaxxers harassing us and trying to intimidate us.\"Several provinces are dropping their COVID-19 vaccine passport programs for entry to restaurants, gyms and other venues, leaving it up to individual businesses to decide if they want to open their doors to unvaccinated customers. \n\n\"You're kind of making businesses choose one side of the fence themselves, where previously governments made that choice for them,\" said Toronto-based retail consultant Bruce Winder. \n\n\"It's going to be a tough one for businesses, because it's such a polarizing topic right now.\"\n\nOn Feb. 9, Alberta became the first province to nix its vaccine passport program.\"The threat of COVID-19 to public health no longer outweighs the hugely damaging impact of health restrictions on our society, on people's mental health, on their emotional well-being,\" Premier Jason Kenney said at a news conference last week. \n\nSaskatchewan was next in line, ending its vaccine passport policy on Monday. Both Ontario and Manitoba plan to drop all proof of vaccination requirements on March 1. Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador will end all vaccine mandates for businesses by mid-March. \n\n'I'm getting 1-star reviews'\nAlthough most businesses are expected to drop their vaccine requirements in line with the provinces, not all are following suit — despite the possibility that they could face a backlash.\n\nDave Kantor, owner of The Cave Beastro in Edmonton, said he decided to keep his restaurant's vaccine mandate in place because he felt it was premature for Alberta to drop the requirement.\"I look at the [COVID-19] numbers. They're still pretty high,\" he said. \"I don't feel that squeezing all kinds of people into a place and getting more people sick is what we need to do right now.\"\n\nHe said his decision has garnered mixed reviews, with some people applauding it. Others, not so much.\n\nKantor says people have told him \"I'm discriminating, I'm segregating, how I'm just a disgusting person for allowing this to go on.\"\n\n\"I'm getting one-star reviews.\"\n\nStill, he says he has no regrets about his decision and won't drop his vaccine requirement until he feels it's safe to do so. Other holdouts include Café Bicyclette in Edmonton.\n\n\"We have taken a more prudent approach,\" said Daniel Cournoyer, executive director of Café Bicyclette. \"So far, overwhelmingly, our patrons are saying, 'Thank you so much for doing so.' \"Saskatoon's Broadway Theatre is maintaining its vaccine mandate for all films and events, according to a post it made on Facebook. \n\nMore than 100 people have commented on the post, some praising the theatre for keeping patrons safe, while others are alleging discrimination. \n\n\"I certainly hope you have legal repercussions for this discriminatory policy,\" wrote one person. \n\nThe theatre declined to comment. \n\nBusinesses may face legal disputes\nAt a news conference earlier this month, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said businesses that maintain their vaccine requirement are now on their own if they face legal disputes.\n\n\"My advice to them would be to consult their lawyer,\" he said. \"Private businesses [are] free to do what they choose, but they also may have some consequences.\"Toronto employment lawyer Tanya Walker of Walker Law said businesses can, in general, impose vaccine mandates for customers.\n\n\"I don't think it should be a problem for a business owner to continue to require that its customers supply proof of vaccination in situations where the customers are in close proximity to each other,\" said Walker. \"[It's] justified to help the public.\" \n\nThe Canadian Civil Liberties Association has said businesses could face a legal challenge if their vaccine requirement infringes on individual human rights, such as refusing entry to someone who can't get vaccinated for medical reasons. \n\nLandmark Cinemas scraps vaccine mandate\nMany businesses, including Landmark Cinemas, are choosing to drop their vaccine requirement in provinces that no longer have mandates.\n\nLandmark's CEO Bill Walker said the theatre company, which has 40 locations across western Canada and Ontario, supports vaccination but also feels it's time to return to some sense of normalcy. \n\nTo help customers feel safe, Walker said theatres will continue to implement safety precautions such as spacing out seating and enforcing mask policies.\"We're going to continue to try to create an experience that makes everyone feel comfortable and welcome and just try to escape and enjoy the movies for a couple of hours,\" he said. \n\nFor Hall, who felt he had to drop the vaccine requirement at Bodhi Tree Yoga, there's some consolation as he believes unvaccinated people aren't interested in coming to his studio anyway.\n\n\"At this point, I think we've kind of alienated everyone who's not vaccinated.\"",

    "content": "Pressure is mounting on Scott Morrison to do more to address climate change, as bushfires continue to burn across the country and smoke blankets Sydney.\n\nThousands of the city’s residents are planning to attend a “climate emergency rally” this evening, where they will demand action. The event’s organisers are urging them to wear face masks as a “symbol of the climate crisis and public health disaster”.\n\nAnd the government has come under renewed pressure this week from a number of prominent voices, including some from its own side of politics.In a blunt speech to the National Smart Energy Summit yesterday, NSW Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean said “no one can deny” the link between bushfires and climate change.\n\n“Let’s call it what it is,” Mr Kean said.\n\n“These bushfires have been caused by extreme weather events – high temperatures, the worst drought in living memory – the exact type of events scientists have been warning us for decades would have been caused by climate change.\n\n“Hotter days, less rain, more drought, worse air quality. That is what the scientists have told us climate change looks like.\n\n“This is not normal and doing nothing is not a solution. If this is not a catalyst for change, then I don’t know what is.\n\n“We need to reduce our carbon emissions immediately, and we need to adapt our practices to deal with this kind of weather becoming the new normal.”\n\nMr Kean expanded on those comments in an interview with the ABC this morning.\n\n“We’ve got the second-hottest year on record in the state of NSW. We’re living through the worst drought in living memory. We’re seeing bushfires earlier than we’ve ever seen them before, and going for longer,” he said.\n\n“You know, some people don’t want to talk about this issue now. I think that the reality is that these bushfires have been going on for weeks, and until we address the causes, we can’t find a solution.”\n\nHe avoided criticising the Morrison government directly, but the implication was clear enough as he urged politicians to “stop putting ideology” into the climate change debate.\n\n“Are there Coalition members, MPs at the federal level, who have been putting ideology into this discussion?” Mr Kean was asked.\n\n“That’s a matter for the federal Coalition. I’m the NSW Environment Minister and if we’re not talking about this issue and taking action on it now, when will we?” he replied.\n\n“There is no country on the planet better placed to take advantage of the new low emissions economy than Australia, and we should be doing our bit to tackle climate change.”Of course, Mr Morrison and his government argue Australia is already doing its part.\n\nEnergy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor is currently attending climate talks in Spain. Overnight, he told that summit Australia was committed to the Paris climate agreement.\n\nBut there is a pretty big sticking point.\n\nThe summit is debating whether countries should be allowed to count “carry-over credits” towards their 2030 emissions reduction targets. In other words, whether “surplus” tonnes of emissions reduction from the Kyoto period (up to 2020) can be carried over to the Paris period (2021-2030).\n\nMr Taylor is arguing in favour of doing that. At the moment, the government plans to carry over 411 million tonnes of abatement to help meet its target of a 26-28 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030.\n\nLabor has labelled that tactic a “dodgy accounting trick”.\n\nBack home, the Prime Minister was criticised yesterday by some Australians, who felt he failed to give enough attention to the bushfires as smoke descended on Sydney.\n\nHe held two media conferences throughout the day – one to give an update on the Australian victims of the White Island volcano eruption, and the other to announce changes to the government’s proposed religious discrimination laws.\n\nThe fires were not mentioned during the first press conference, for obvious reasons, but actually did come up at some length during the second one as Mr Morrison fielded repeated questions on the subject.“Our policy is sensible when it comes to addressing and taking action on climate change. Our actions on climate change are getting the results they’re intended to get,” he said.\n\n“The policies that we’re pursuing capture, I believe, that sensible centre that understands that we need to balance both meeting the needs of sustainability in our environment and ensuring that we meet the economic needs of our nation.”\n\nMr Morrison went on to slam the 45 per cent emissions reduction target Labor took to the election.\n\n“It was an economy-wrecking set of targets,” said the Prime Minister.\n\n“People know where I stand on these issues, they know clearly where I stand. I don’t go changing my mind on these things because I know how important both of them are.\n\n“I think Australians take some comfort in the certainty and consistency of our views, particularly now, where I note that I don’t know what the Labor Party believes anymore because they change their view, and they have so many different views on these issues.\n\n“I don’t know what the Labor Party thinks anymore, whether it’s on climate change or anything else. They seem to be just saying things that people want to hear. They look up their location services enabler and if it says they are in North Queensland, they say one thing, and if they are in Melbourne they say something else.”That press conference happened before Mr Kean’s speech. But he is not the only Coalition figure who has pushed for greater action on climate change this week.\n\nMr Morrison’s predecessor Malcolm Turnbull appeared on Q&A on Monday night, where he said better “national leadership” was required.\n\nHe called for a national summit to come up with new ideas for managing bushfires.“The government’s policy on climate is being held to ransom by a group of deniers within the party and in the media and other sections outside the parliament. Therein lies the problem,” the former prime minister said.\n\n“We do have to come together and recognise that this situation with fires is going to become worse.”\n\nAnother former Liberal leader, John Hewson, has accused the government of having a “tin ear” on climate change.\n\n“Morrison’s got a particular prejudice. And it is a prejudice. He has a prejudice in favour of coal and fossil fuels, and is against any transition to a low carbon future,” Mr Hewson told The New Daily.\n\n“The government is really exposed on this issue. They’ve got bushfires and drought and they don’t want to talk about climate. They’re looking pretty ridiculous right now.”\n\nAnd outside politics, former High Court justice and royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne has taken his own subtle swing at the government for treating climate change as an ideological argument.\n\n“Framing the most recent debates provoked by the bushfire emergencies as part of the ‘culture wars’ reinforces the notion that climate science is a matter of belief, not scientific observation and extrapolation,” Mr Hayne told the Centre for Policy Development this week.\n\n“Because the debate remains framed as a debate about belief, learned helplessness and short termism can be translated into the nativist, populist terms that now have such currency in many political systems.”Mr Morrison was asked to address many of those criticisms.\n\n“On the bushfire crisis, will you be co-ordinating a national response, as was suggested by Malcolm Turnbull?” a reporter asked him yesterday.\n\n“We already do,” Mr Morrison replied.\n\n“I think one of the great encouragements that I’ve seen through this process is we’ve had a nationally co-ordinated operation through all of our state and territory fire chiefs and services now for some time.”\n\nHe highlighted the federal government’s contribution to developing “aerial firefighting assets”, saying it had put an additional $11 million into that area this year because it knew Australia was facing a “very difficult fire season”.\n\n“There is already a nationally co-ordinated effort,” Mr Morrison repeated. “That was one of the things that came out of the Black Saturday fires many years ago.”\n\n“On calls for that national co-ordination that is occurring now to be led at a higher level within the federal government?” a reporter pressed.\n\n“It’s led by a Cabinet minister who reports directly to me, and I deal with it directly with the premiers of the states and chief ministers of the territories. I don’t think it can go any higher than that,” Mr Morrison said.\n\n“But these calls were still being made as late as yesterday?” the reporter said.\n\n“Do you think that national co-ordination is happening adequately? There are a lot of concerns about how long volunteer firefighters are supposed to continue volunteering without pay. They are crowdsourcing funds for water and food and resources on the ground. Do you think there is more the federal government can do?”\n\n“The state governments get everything they request from the commonwealth, and there is a national co-ordinated process for requests to be made to the commonwealth for that assistance,” the Prime Minister said.\n\n“So no, I don’t share that view, because I know what the practice is and I know what the experience is and I know what’s happening on the ground.”\n\nMr Morrison was once again asked whether the government would consider paying volunteer firefighters, whose task keeps dragging on.\n\n“Well we have a volunteer firefighting force across the country which numbers in the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. And that also includes those who come in from other jurisdictions. It is a standing volunteer force,” he said.\n\n“These are matters that are considered from time to time, but this is why I am so appreciative of the commitment made by employers to support that volunteer effort. The volunteer effort is a big part of our natural disaster response and it is a big part of how Australia has always dealt with these issues.\n\n“We are constantly looking at ways to better facilitate the volunteer effort, but to professionalise that at that scale is not a matter that has previously been accepted and it’s not a matter that is currently under consideration.\n\n“The fact is these crews, yes they’re tired, but they also want to be out there defending their communities. And so we do all we can to rotate their shifts to give them those breaks, but equally they – and in many cases you’ve got to hold them back to make sure they get that rest. And I thank them all for what they’re doing.”Forty fires across NSW are still uncontained. The Rural Fire Service says 2.7 million hectares have been burnt and more than 700 homes have been destroyed.\n\nAdding to the growing pressure on Mr Morrison, this year’s edition of the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) was released last night, and it ranked Australia 56th out of 61 countries.\n\nOn the report’s specific “climate policy” measure, we ranked dead last, with a rather striking score of 0.0. The CCPI’s authors accused Mr Morrison’s government of being “an increasingly regressive force” on the issue.\n\nMr Morrison has not spoken so far today, but Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack did pop up to launch a fulsome defence of the coal industry.\n\n“I support an industry that provides jobs and provides tens of billions of dollars worth of exports, tens of thousands of jobs and the energy that this country needs,” the Nationals leader told reporters in Mackay.\n\n“Many of the greenies who sit in their terraced houses in far off capital cities ought to know that that’s where their energy supply comes from too.\n\n“It’s all well and good for them to snub their noses at the coal industry, to snub their noses at those people who work in the mining industry, but they ought to know that the mining industry providing $62 billion of exports is helping to pay for many of the state schools and hospitals they need and want.”\n\nHis comments came as Labor leader Anthony Albanese headed to Rockhampton, the latest stop in his tour of Queensland’s coal country.",

    "content": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Actor James Woods has been locked out of his Twitter account over a tweet he sent out months ago that was found to be in violation of Twitter’s rules.\n\nThe tweet was posted July 20 and includes a hoax meme that said it came from Democrats and encouraged men not to vote in the midterm elections. Woods got an email from Twitter on Thursday saying the tweet “has the potential to be misleading in a way that could impact an election.” The email says Woods can use his account again if he deletes the tweet.In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, Woods said this means he’ll be allowed back on Twitter only if he decides to do what Twitter says. He says he won’t do that, and he won’t delete the tweet.\n\n“Free speech is free speech — it’s not Jack Dorsey’s version of free speech,” Woods said, referring to Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey.\n\nTwitter said it doesn’t comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons. A spokesman for the social media platform said by email that he had nothing more to share when asked if Dorsey would respond directly to Wood’s comments.\n\n“The irony is, Twitter accused me of affecting the political process, when in fact, their banning of me is the truly egregious interference,” Woods said. “Because now, having your voice smothered is much more disturbing than having your vocal chords slit. If you want to kill my free speech, man up and slit my throat with a knife, don’t smother me with a pillow.”\n\nWoods said if he deletes the tweet, it would force him to watch his step with everything he says in the future, chilling free speech. The email Woods received from Twitter said Woods would be suspended from the social media platform permanently if there are repeated abuses.\n\nHe noted that his original tweet was reposted by his girlfriend on Friday and had been retweeted thousands of times by Sunday. His girlfriend’s account wasn’t locked, which he said was proof that he’d been singled out because of his large Twitter following.\n\nWoods, who has more than 100 acting credits to his name and starred in several movies including “Salvador,” ″Ghosts of Mississippi” and “Casino,” has more than 1.7 million Twitter followers and is known for his conservative political views. His Twitter page is still online, though he can’t access it. Many of his recent tweets include his views of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago.The meme that Woods posted in July said #LetWomenDecide and #NoMenMidterm. It claimed to be from a Democratic group, but it was determined to be a hoax campaign to encourage liberal men not to vote in November, according to the website knowyourmeme.com.\n\nWoods called it a parody. In his tweet, he acknowledged the meme likely wasn’t real, saying: “Pretty scary that there is a distinct possibility this could be real. Not likely, but in this day and age of absolute liberal insanity, it is at least possible ...”\n\nThe tweet is considered to be material that would suppress votes or deliberately deceive, and was found to be in violation of Twitter rules.\n\nSocial media companies like Twitter have come under pressure to get hate speech and posts that could influence elections offline, learning quickly that they can’t please everyone as they try to act as gatekeepers of discourse. Dorsey testified before the GOP-led House Energy and Commerce Committee earlier this month, as the committee examined whether Twitter has censored conservatives.\n\nThe AP reached Woods on Sunday through his girlfriend’s Twitter account. After he shared information over messaging, he agreed to have a FaceTime conversation so the AP could verify his identity.\n\nWoods said he wants open discourse, and called the situation a dangerous one for free speech.\n\n“I wish this were about an unknown Twitter user so that I could be even more passionate about it,” Woods said. “This is not about a celebrity being muzzled. This is about an American being silenced — one tweet at a time.”",

    "content": "A Bangladesh court has sentenced 16 people to death for the murder of a student set on fire after accusing her teacher of sexual harassment.\n\nNusrat Jahan Rafi, 19, died in April in Feni, a small town some 160km (100 miles) outside the capital Dhaka.\n\nThose convicted of murder included the headteacher Nusrat had accused of harassment and two female classmates.\n\nHer murder shocked the country and led to a series of protests demanding justice for Nusrat.\n\nThe trial has been one of the quickest in a country where such cases usually take years to conclude. Prosecutor Hafez Ahmed told reporters it proved \"that nobody will get away with murder in Bangladesh\".\n\nHowever, the quick conclusion of the case did little to ease her mother's agony on Thursday.\n\n\"I can't forget her for a moment,\" Shirin Akhtar told news agency Reuters through tears upon hearing the verdict. \"I still feel the pain that she went through.\"\n\nLawyers for the defendants say they will appeal.\n\nThe investigation into Nusrat's death revealed a conspiracy to silence her which included her own classmates and a number of powerful men from within the community.\n\nThree teachers, including the headmaster, Siraj Ud Doula, who police say ordered the killing from prison after he was arrested under suspicion of harassment, were found guilty by the court on Thursday. Another two of the defendants convicted, Ruhul Amin and Maksud Alam, are local leaders of the ruling Awami League party.\n\nA number of local police were found to have collaborated with those convicted in spreading false information that Nusrat had committed suicide. The officers were not among those tried for Nusrat's murder.Nusrat's family, who supported her decision to go to police back in March, have since been given police protection. Her brother Mahmudul Hasan Noman said they were still in fear for their lives.\n\n\"You already know they threatened me in public inside the courtroom,\" he told reporters. \"I am very afraid. I am urging the prime minister to ensure our security. And the police super should also keep a track on our wellbeing.\"\n\nHowever, the family welcomed the verdict, asking for the sentence to be carried out quickly. In Bangladesh, the death penalty is carried out by hanging\n\nPresentational grey line\nAnger, tears and a fight for justice\nAkbar Hossain, BBC Bengali, in Feni\n\nWhen the judge announced the verdict, some of the defendants burst into tears, while others shouted out across the courtroom that they had been denied justice.\n\nBut in Bangladesh, it is more usually women like Nusrat who are denied justice.\n\nSexual harassment in Bangladesh's education institutions - including madrassas like the one Nusrat attended - is widespread, while the cost of speaking out is high.\n\nPresentational grey line\nWhat happened to Nusrat?\nShe was lured to her school's rooftop on 6 April this year, 11 days after she reported the headmaster to police for repeatedly touching her inappropriately.\n\nNusrat was then surrounded by four or five people wearing burqas, pressuring her to withdraw her complaint.\n\nWhen she refused, they set her on fire.\n\nAccording to police, they had hoped to make it look like a suicide. Instead, she managed to escape and get help.\n\nBut knowing she was badly hurt, she gave a statement which her brother filmed on his phone.\n\n\"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath,\" she says, naming some of her attackers.\n\nNusrat, who had sustained burns to 80% of her body, died four days later, on 10 April.\n\nHow widespread is sexual abuse in Bangladesh?\nSexual harassment is thought to be relatively commonplace in Bangladesh: a recent report by charity ActionAid earlier this year found 80% of women working in Bangladesh's garment industry have either seen or experienced sexual violence at work.\n\nMeanwhile, women's rights group Mahila Parishad said that, in the first six months of 2019, a total of 26 women were killed after being sexually assaulted, 592 were allegedly raped and 113 women said they were gang raped.\n\nHowever, these are just the reported figures: there are fears the true number is far higher.\n\nSpeaking out like Nusrat is still uncommon as reporting sexual harassment carries risks. Victims often face judgement from their communities, harassment, in person and online, and in some cases violent attacks.Nusrat was particularly unusual because she went to the police. They filmed her statement on a mobile phone - which was later leaked to the media.\n\nMeanwhile, protesters took to the streets to demand the release of the headmaster, leading her family to fear for her safety.\n\nHow did the public react to Nusrat's murder?\nThe case sparked mass protests in Bangladesh and shone a spotlight on the vulnerability of victims of sexual assault and harassment in the country.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina publicly pledged that \"none of the culprits will be spared from legal action\". Her interest in the case was praised by the family.\n\n\"We never imagined that justice will be ensured so fast by the prime minister,\" Mahmudul Hasan Noman told reporters. \"We want to express our gratitude to her directly in person. Hopefully she will give us a chance to do it. \"\n\nThe police initially dismissed the sexual harassment allegations but laid charges against the 16 accused in May. The specially fast-tracked hearing took just 62 days to complete.\n\nActivists say the killing exposed a culture of impunity around sex crimes. Whether more victims of sexual abuse will feel emboldened to come forward following Nusrat's case remains to be seen.",

And prescription painkillers took the highest toll, but posted the smallest increase. Abuse of drugs like Oxycontin and Vicodin killed 17,536, an increase of 4 percent.“I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything like this. Certainly not in modern times,” said Robert Anderson, who oversees death statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe new numbers were part of the agency’s annual tally of deaths and death rates in 2015.\n\nOverall, overdose deaths rose 11 percent last year, to 52,404. By comparison, the number of people who died in car crashes was 37,757, an increase of 12 percent. Gun deaths, including homicides and suicides, totaled 36,252, up 7 percent.As part of its annual report, the CDC also found that rates for 8 of the 10 leading causes of death rose last year, causing the nation’s life expectancy to go down for the first time in more than 20 years. Drug overdoses were a significant factor, but an unexpected increase in the death rate from heart disease, the nation’s No. 1 killer, was another major reason.",

It is, appropriately, for three years initially with Three’s logo to appear on all of Chelsea’s shirts from 2020/21, including Chelsea Women and Academy sides as well as our men’s team. The partnership covers the whole Chelsea family.\n\nIn addition, Three, which has grown from being the UK’s first 3G-only network in 2003 to having the UK’s leading 5G spectrum holdings with more than the rest of the industry combined, launched 5G services in 2019 and will ensure Stamford Bridge is 5G-enabled within the first year of the partnership.\n\nThe deal is a significant one for Chelsea financially but it is also important our official partnerships are a good fit and our new shirt one with Three clearly is.\n\nChelsea Football Club chief executive Guy Laurence explains:\n\n‘Mobile technology has revolutionised the way football clubs and supporters interact with each other which makes Chelsea FC and Three such natural partners.\n\n‘We have a social media following of over 100 million and the official app, The 5th Stand, has had nearly four million downloads.

    "content": "IMPHAL, India — When separatist rebels in the remote Indian state of Manipur banned Hindi movies a decade ago, they had little idea it would trigger a cultural invasion from a country more than 2,000 miles away.\n\nBut when Bollywood was forced out, the Koreans moved in.\n\nIn the markets of the state capital Imphal, shops are packed with DVDs of South Korean films and television soap operas, as well as CDs of Korean pop stars, with a particular focus on preening boy bands.\n\nHairdressing salons are covered with head shots of Korean celebrities and offer a wide range of spiky, \"Korean-style\" cuts which are hugely popular with young Manipuris of both sexes.\n\nTeenagers also trawl through Gambhir Market, a three-story warren of tiny boutiques, for skinny jeans and other clothing trends inspired by Korean television shows.\n\nEven the language has made inroads, with Korean phrases like annyeong-haseyo (hello), kamsahamnida (thank you) and sarang-haeyo (I love you) peppering conversations in schoolyards and market-places.\n\n\"When we're back at boarding school, my friends and I practice our few phrases of Korean and often talk about what it would be like growing up in Korea,\" said female student Akshaya Longjam, 14.\n\n\"It just seems so much fun and everybody is good-looking; the girls are pretty and the boys are so cute,\" said Longjam, a dedicated fan of the Korean boy band Big Bang and its star singer G-Dragon.\n\nAt first glance, Manipur would seem the unlikeliest of takers for the so-called \"Korean Wave\" of pop culture that swept over China, Japan and much of Southeast Asia at the beginning of the last decade.\n\nTiny, landlocked and with a population of less than three million, Manipur borders Myanmar and is one of India's \"Seven Sisters\" -- seven northeastern states connected to the rest of India by a sliver of land that arches over Bangladesh.\n\nIn the 1970s, 80s and 90s, entertainment for Manipuris was largely supplied by India's dominant cultural force, Bollywood.\n\nBut then in 2000, a number of the multiple armed secessionist groups that have been active in Manipur since the 1960s ordered a ban on Hindi movies and Hindi satellite TV channels, in a professed bid to \"protect\" Manipuri culture.\n\nBacked by threats to bomb recalcitrant cinemas and cable operators, the ban was extremely effective and remains in force today.\n\nDesperate to fill the vacuum, cable operators experimented with whatever came to hand, including Arirang TV, a 24-hour, English-language network based in Seoul that began beaming in a diet of dramas and cultural features.\n\nKorea's KBS World followed with its own stable of subtitled soap operas and, within a few months, Manipur was hooked.\n\n\"Watching Korean soaps and films takes me away from the realities of daily life in Manipur,\" said 19-year-old college student Soma Lhishram.\n\n\"We have a problem with water, electricity, roads... you name it. But everything looks so perfect in Korea. It's like a fantasy world.\"\n\nThe attraction is partly a cultural one. The Mongol roots of ethnic Manipuris mean their physical features are far closer to those of Koreans than other Indians.\n\nThe family-oriented soap operas resonate strongly in what is a socially conservative state, while teen romance dramas have a mass following among the young.\n\nLhishram, a part-time actress, is a particular fan of the high school drama \"Boys Over Flowers\" and one of its heartthrob stars, Lee Min-Hoo.\n\n\"It's a big dream of mine to travel to Korea and to work on a film there,\" she said during a break in shooting for a Manipuri language music video in the grounds of a local college.\n\nEndless repeat viewings of all shows are also available thanks to thousands of English-subtitled DVDs -- many of them pirated -- which are smuggled in from Myanmar and retail in Imphal markets for less than a dollar.\n\nOtojit Kshetrimayum, a research scholar in sociology at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, has written an academic paper on the phenomenal popularity of all things Korean in Manipur.\n\n\"The key factor is cultural proximity, both in appearance and values,\" Kshetrimayum said. \"The themes and characters that the Korean movies and dramas depict strike a chord with both the younger and older generations in Manipur.\"",

The last time an enthronement ceremony took place was in 1990, when the then-emperor Akihito formally ascended the throne.Small crowds turned out on Tuesday morning outside the palace despite a heavy downpour.\"Today is an important day for the new emperor and the empress,\" 78-year-old Shuichi Hachinuma, who had travelled to Tokyo, told news agency AFP.\n\n\"I feel the emperor is closer to us, compared to in the past... I want him to send a message of peace.\"\n\nThe torrential winds and rains cleared just as the ceremony began.\n\nSome social media users claimed a rainbow appeared just in time for the ceremony.Didn't Naruhito already ascend the throne?\nEmperor Naruhito officially began his reign on 1 May.\n\nAccording to news site the Japan Times, the ceremonies conducted on that day were \"simpler, and meant to signify the inheritance of the throne immediately\".\n\nThe Sokui no rei was a much more elaborate affair.\n\nIt's not uncommon for there to be a gap between the first succession to the throne and the Sokui no rei.\n\nFor Emperor Akihito, there was an almost two-year gap between his succession to the throne and the Sokui no rei.\n\nAccording to one Japanese expert, the reason for the confusion this time round was because then-Emperor Akihito's abdication broke away from the normal procedure.\n\nHe abdicated due to poor health, becoming the first monarch to abdicate in more than 200 years.Usually, the celebratory enthronement can only take place after at least a year of mourning.\n\nBut because Emperor Akihito had stepped down, the ascension of Emperor Naruhito then was seen as much more of a celebration.\n\n\"The world just assumed that that [on 1 May] was the combined celebration, but the real celebration is what's happening now,\" Ken Ruoff, author of Japan's Imperial House in the Postwar Era, told the BBC.\n\n\"It's not perceived as a big deal [to] the rest of the world who are like 'didn't we already do this?' But it's a big deal for the Japanese.\"",

    "content": "The Catholic Church found itself at the heart of one of its most serious crises yet when a Pennsylvania grand jury released a report last week, detailing the extent of child sex abuse allegations by Catholic priests in six of the state’s eight dioceses. The report estimated more than 300 priests across the state abused at least 1,000 known victims, and it condemned the wider clerical culture that allowed senior priests to turn a blind eye to the abuses, often quietly shuffling offending priests into new dioceses, where they would have unfettered access to new victims.\n\nThe allegations pointed to a systemic culture of secrecy in the Catholic Church, and implicated a number of church officials — including Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, DC — in the cover-up.\n\nThe Vatican has called the content of the allegations “criminal and morally reprehensible,” adding, “those acts were betrayals of trust that robbed survivors of their dignity and their faith. The church must learn hard lessons from its past, and there should be accountability for both abusers and those who permitted abuse to occur.” Pope Francis has also issued a striking personal apology, saying “we showed no care for the little ones.”\n\nBut one of the most pressing questions the release of the report has raised: Why now? This latest report comes 16 years after the initial wave of child sex abuse allegations rocked the Catholic Church in America. In 2002, the Boston Globe’s reporting into sex abuse, and its cover-up, in the Boston area kindled a wider reckoning within the Catholic Church in the US, and exposed both widespread abuse and systemic secrecy across the country.\n\nNew policy has since been established requiring clergy to turn over all reports of sexual abuse to police, and a report was commissioned on the extent of the abuse. And yet decades-old allegations are still coming out in 2018. So why are we still learning about how massive the system is that has kept this abuse a secret? The answer is complicated, and speaks as much as to the sheer scope of the crisis itself as it does to the change in culture that is allowing these cases to come to light.\n\nThe abuse cases we’re seeing are almost all from decades ago\nMost of the allegations in the Pennsylvania report are decades old, predating the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ (USCCB) 2002 Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, more commonly known as the Dallas Charter. Under this system of reforms, which followed the Globe’s reporting, the USCCB now mandates church leaders to report instances of abuse taking place 2002 to law enforcement, rather than handle the abuse among leaders. With these reforms, the peak of allegations also predate a general cultural shift in the US Catholic Church.\n\nCentral to the arguments of many of the Vatican’s defenders is that the Dallas Charter represented, in essence, a cleave between the Church’s past and its future. Because the USCCB had immediately instituted this series of reforms, and because these reforms have, by and large, effectively curbed abuse in the Church, there was less pressure on the Church to air its dirty laundry of past misdeeds, especially when crimes were old enough that the accused were dead, retired, or beyond the statute of limitations. A general focus on what the Church was doing right, after 2002, lessened the pressure on the Church to publicize the full extent of its earlier cases.\n\nFor example, Matt Haverstick, an attorney at Philadelphia-based Kleinbard LLC, which represents two of the dioceses named in the report — Harrisburg and Greensburg — told Vox that abuse cases have dropped precipitously since the 1970s and ’80s, and even more so since 2002. (The grand jury report data notes that the bulk of the cases listed happened before the 2000s.)\n\nAdditionally, he said, “the church is out of the investigative business.” Now law enforcement, and not internal church bureaucracies, investigates any allegations of abuse, he told Vox. “They pass these [cases] off to law enforcement and let law enforcement take the first crack at deciding what happened before the church will even touch it.”\n\nDavid Gibson, the head of the Fordham University Center for Religion and Culture and a longtime writer on Catholic issues, concurred. The material, he said, is a vital “historical record” of a time of extensive abuse and corruption within the church, that is important to make public. But Gibson said it was important to note that the culture described in the report shouldn’t necessarily be conflated with the church’s policies or approach today, or indeed, of the past 18 years. “The grand jury report actually shows how the system has worked,” he said, referring to the Dallas charter and a wider cultural shift.\n\nCultural change is only part of the answer\nEarlier this summer, then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick experienced a public fall from grace after victims went on record with the New York Times about abuse they experienced as minors and as seminarians under his tutelage. While none of McCarrick’s accusers explicitly cited the #MeToo movement as impetus for their coming forward, a change in attitudes toward those who raise allegations of abuse has made speaking out less difficult.\n\nGibson says the timing of the McCarrick case and the Pennsylvania revelations has led to a new reckoning with the enormity and legacy of the Catholic sex abuse scandal.\n\n“There’s a ‘perfect storm’ element to this whole thing,” he told Vox. “The Pennsylvania grand jury report was two years in the making and it happened to come out just as the reports about Cardinal McCarrick came out, which were totally unrelated. And it also comes out at a time when we have social media, which amplifies these things.” Gibson also cited the spread of allegations in other countries like Chile, where the entire group of Chilean bishops resigned over the handling — and alleged cover-up — of child sex abuse.\n\nGibson said discontent over Pope Francis’s leadership among conservative Catholics also has galvanized some to speak out more forcefully, despite conservatives traditionally being more protective of the church as an institution.\n\nMassimo Faggioli, a professor of theology at Villanova University, argues that conservative Catholics are more vocal than usual in demanding accountability from church leaders because they see the crisis as a chance to push back on what they see as the influence of Vatican II, the formative 1962-’65 council that conservatives see as moving the church in a too “modern,” less orthodox direction. Some conservatives may be more willing to express discontent with church structure — and advocate for reform — than they might have been under a more conservative pope.\n\n“Some see the opportunity to reform the Church from abuses as a counter-revolution ... against the Church of Vatican II itself,” Faggioli told Vox in an email, “something that would not have been imaginable under ... John Paul II.”\n\nBut the timing of the Pennsylvania report itself speaks less to a specific change in culture of believing abuse victims than it does the catastrophically slow turning of the cogs in the Catholic bureaucratic machine, and the sheer scope of the crisis.\n\nThe grand jury investigation involved the subpoenaing of a staggering half-million pages of reports from dioceses and churches over two years. Many of the priests implicated are retired or dead. And because dioceses operate relatively autonomously, a massive amount of legwork was needed to centralize and process that information.\n\nThe political will, and ability, do to that kind of legwork is relatively rare.\n\nAs Gibson pointed out, the very nature of the grand jury report is atypical. Only a few states have provisions for this kind of investigative work before any criminal charges are filed, of which Pennsylvania is one. In that state, the prosecutor’s office has the authority to commission grand jury investigations before filing charges, often in cases that involve widespread corruption or conspiracy (such as the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse case at Penn State, which was also investigated by grand jury).\n\nAnd the political climate of recent years has made this kind of grand jury operation less of a risk for prosecutors. ”Twenty years ago, it would have been political suicide to investigate the Catholic Church [in Pennsylvania],” Gibson says. “Now it’s a political résumé builder to do an investigation like this.” (Indeed, Attorney-General Josh Shapiro has already been accused by critics of capitalizing on the investigation publicity to launch a political career).\n\nEven with political goodwill, however, the steps involved in commissioning a report of this scale are complex. Shapiro began his grand jury investigation into clerical sex abuse in the state because the case was first referred to him by a local prosecutor. In 2013, an Ohio diocese settled with 11 men over allegations of abuse by a local Franciscan friar, Stephen Baker. That settlement, in turn, triggered more allegations that the friar had abused boys at a Pennsylvania Catholic school in Cambria County in the late 1990’s. While Baker committed suicide shortly after the settlement, the investigation was handed over to the Attorney General’s office by a Cambria district attorney. That investigation, which expanded to include cases across the state, turned into two grand jury investigations: one, covering Altoona–Johnstown and Philadelphia dioceses back in 2016, and the current one, which covers the remainder of the dioceses.\n\nThe church’s reluctance to publicize its own findings also played a part, Gibson said. Some of the named priests attempted to stop the release of the grand jury’s findings, which led to the report being partially redacted. Furthermore, only a minority of churches have preemptively listed the names of implicated clergy.\n\n“The dioceses in Pennsylvania did not want to publicly list all of those who had allegations ... there was no push by the church to do it,” Gibson said. In part, he said, this reluctance was due to the age of the allegations — most of the offenders were retired or dead, and nearly all were beyond the statute of limitations.\n\nThe church’s next challenge will be contending with priests who looked the other way\nThe lessons of the Pennsylvania report are manyfold. On the one hand, the report speaks to the sheer scope and scale of the crimes committed, and the difficulty — and necessity — of centralizing myriad accounts of abuse, even decades after the fact. It also reveals the relative reluctance of the church to make public its internal failings: While individual dioceses named priests using available church documents, the church as a whole has failed to do so.\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge ahead will be instituting a church culture that not only takes the accounts of victims seriously but also has protocols to deal with wider structural failings.\n\nAs James Martin, a Jesuit priest and Catholic commentator, told Vox: “The Dallas reforms are extremely stringent, and make it clear that any priest credibly accused of any sort of abuse is removed from ministry immediately. So there should be, at this point, no priest with any credible accusation against him in active ministry. But the missing link is how bishops who have covered up these crimes are treated.”\n\nThe Dallas reforms have no protocol for how to deal with those who looked the other way. Those implicated in cover-ups, such as Archbishop Donald Wuerl, remain in positions of clerical authority.\n\nUltimately, however, the greatest lesson of the Pennsylvania report is the importance of centralizing varied narratives of abuse, for the church to both take responsibility for its history and move forward. As Gibson puts it, “In many ways, this whole scandal demonstrates the power of storytelling and the importance of storytelling and giving shape and weight to all these accusations. It’s important to get the historical record out there, and the Catholic Church in the United States has not been good enough at doing that.”",

The country, which has a population of 10 million, has recorded 609,000 cases and 9,920 deaths as of Jan. 22, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. \n\nThis is the second time that the bishops have suspended public worship. The first was in March 2020, when the pandemic arrived in the country located on the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain. The restrictions were eased at the end of May.\n\nThe bishops said that public Masses would be suspended from Jan. 23 -- the day before the country's presidential election -- along with catechesis and other pastoral activities that required people to gather. They called on priests to offer livestreamed Masses. \n\nThe bishops had called for the suspension or postponement of baptisms, confirmations, and marriages earlier this month.\n\nThey said that funerals could be celebrated according to norms issued in May last year, which require mourners to maintain a social distance.\n\nA Lenten retreat for the bishops, scheduled for Feb. 22-26, has also been canceled.\n\nThe Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which has been hit hard financially by the pandemic, will broadcast three Masses and two rosary prayers daily while public Masses are suspended. \n\nThe Masses, which will be transmitted via the shrine's website, will take place at 11 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. local time. The rosary will be recited at 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. local time.\n\nShrine rector Fr. Carlos Cabecinhas said: \"We know that it is not the same to be physically present or to be able to follow on television, but that is the one possible way we have to participate now and therefore we want to be present with you through this difficult moment.\"",

    "content": "Pope Francis held the special Urbi et Orbi on Friday from the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nUsually a colorful event reserved only for Christmas Day and Easter Sunday, this extraordinary blessing was held in keeping with the gravity of the current global situation, as more than half of the world’s population is confined to their homes to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nStanding in a deserted St. Peter’s Square with a steady rain falling, Pope Francis spoke to the world through all the means of modern communication: Facebook, YouTube, TV, and radio.\n\nSymbols of faith\nHe prayed for the world at this critical juncture in the presence of two images that have accompanied the people of Rome for centuries: the ancient icon of Mary Salus Populi Romani – usually housed in the Basilica of St. Mary Major – and the miraculous crucifix kept in the church of San Marcello on the city’s Via del Corso.\n\nMost importantly, the Pope exposed the Blessed Sacrament for adoration and imparted his Apostolic Blessing, offering everyone the opportunity to receive a plenary indulgence.Evening meditation\nBut first, Pope Francis offered a meditation on the crisis facing the world, reflecting on a passage from the Gospel of Mark (4:35-41).\n\n“For weeks now it has been evening,” said the Pope. “Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities; it has taken over our lives, filling everything with a deafening silence and a distressing void, that stops everything as it passes by; we feel it in the air, we notice it in people’s gestures, their glances give them away.”\n\nIn this situation, he said, we feel afraid and lost, like the disciples whose boat was in danger of sinking while Jesus slept at the stern.\n\nAll in the same boat\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has reminded us that we are all on the same boat, said Pope Francis, and so we call out to Jesus. The disciples ask Him, “Teacher, do you not care if we perish?”\n\nThe Pope said these words would have shaken Jesus, “because He, more than anyone, cares about us.”\n\nThe storm, said the Pope, exposes “our vulnerability and uncovers those false and superfluous certainties around which we have constructed our daily schedules” and lays bare “all those attempts to anesthetize ourselves”.\n\nWhat is revealed, he said, is “our belonging as brothers and sisters”, our common humanity.\n\n“Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?\nPope Francis then picked up the thread of Jesus’ question: “Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?”\n\nHe said we have all gone ahead “at breakneck speed”, ignoring the wars, injustice, and cries of the poor and our ailing planet. “We carried on regardless, thinking we would stay healthy in a world that was sick.”\n\nIn our stormy sea, we now cry out: “Wake up, Lord!”Now is the time of choosing\nReally, said Pope Francis, it is Jesus calling out to us to be converted, calling us to faith.\n\n“You are calling on us to seize this time of trial as a time of choosing,” he said.\n\nNow is not the time of God’s judgment, but of our own: “a time to choose what matters and what passes away, a time to separate what is necessary from what is not.”\n\nThe Pope said we can draw lessons from the many people who – even though fearful – have reacted by giving their lives, including medical personnel, supermarket clerks, cleaners, priests, police officers, and volunteers. This, he said, “is the force of the Spirit poured out and fashioned in courageous and generous self-denial.”\n\nStripped of our self-sufficiency\nPope Francis said faith begins “when we realize we are in need of salvation” and are not self-sufficient.\n\nIf we turn to Jesus and hand Him our fears, said the Pope, He will conquer them.\n\n“Because this is God’s strength: turning to the good everything that happens to us, even the bad things. He brings serenity into our storms, because with God life never dies.”\n\nSo God asks us now, in the midst of the tempest, “to reawaken and put into practice that solidarity and hope capable of giving strength, support and meaning to these hours when everything seems to be floundering.”\n\nHis cross is our hope\nJesus’ cross, said Pope Francis, is the anchor that has saved us, the rudder that has redeemed us, and our hope, because “by His cross we have been healed and embraced so that nothing and no one can separate us from His redeeming love.”\n\n“In the midst of isolation when we are suffering from a lack of tenderness and chances to meet up, and we experience the loss of so many things,” he said, “let us once again listen to the proclamation that saves us: He is risen and is living by our side.”\n\nSo we embrace His cross in the hardships of the present time, and make room in our hearts “for the creativity that only the Spirit is capable of inspiring.”\n\n“Embracing the Lord in order to embrace hope: that is the strength of faith, which frees us from fear and gives us hope.”\n\nTurning to the Lord\nConcluding his meditation, Pope Francis entrusted us all to the Lord, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, so that our faith might not waiver in this time of crisis.\n\n“Dear brothers and sisters, from this place that tells of Peter’s rock-solid faith, I would like this evening to entrust all of you to the Lord, through the intercession of Mary, Health of the People and Star of the stormy Sea. From this colonnade that embraces Rome and the whole world, may God’s blessing come down upon you as a consoling embrace. Lord, may you bless the world, give health to our bodies and comfort our hearts. You ask us not to be afraid. Yet our faith is weak and we are fearful. But you, Lord, will not leave us at the mercy of the storm. Tell us again: ‘Do not be afraid’ (Mt 28:5). And we, together with Peter, ‘cast all our anxieties onto you, for you care about us’ (cf. 1Pet 5:7).”",

    "content": "The shutdown of a major fuel pipeline in the U.S. is a cybersecurity wakeup call for EU energy operators.\n\nPreliminary investigations indicate that a group of Russian criminal hackers known as Darkside were likely behind the ransomware attack that shut down the nearly 9,000-kilometer Colonial Pipeline — which transports almost half the jet fuel, diesel, gasoline and heating fuel used on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nSimilar incidents have happened in Europe.Russia-based cyberattacks on critical energy infrastructure have put the EU on high alert since 2014, when the annexation of Crimea and war in the Donbas led to Ukraine being hit with a series of attacks crippling everything from power grids to election systems.\n\nThose infiltrations culminated in the 2017 NotPetya attack, which paralyzed multinationals like the Danish shipping giant Maersk, logistics giant FedEx, pharma company Merck and other major corporations, and cost an estimated $10 billion to clean up.\n\nSince then, the EU has moved to strengthen its energy system resilience — but the work is far from over.\n\n\"The attack on Colonial just screams out for new regulation on critical infrastructure companies,\" said Bart Groothuis, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who leads negotiations on draft EU rules for cybersecurity of networks and IT systems.\n\nAccording to the European Union's Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA), the sector reported roughly 100 significant cybersecurity incidents in 2020 — half of which were ransomware attacks.\n\nAssessing the vulnerabilities\nEnergy system operators in Europe have so far faced only limited requirements under the bloc's first-ever 2016 cybersecurity legislation, the Networks and Information Security (NIS) Directive— as well as some sectoral legislation.Those include applying minimum cybersecurity standards and promptly reporting incidents as they happen.\n\nAccording to the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), the most exposed elements of the bloc's pipeline systems are so-called SCADAs — supervisory control and data acquisition systems that govern hardware such as pressure-reducing stations, valves and compressor stations.\n\n\"These are typically not linked to any other network, precisely to reduce the exposure to cyberattacks,\" said ACER spokesperson Una Shortall.\n\nThe Colonial attack, however, didn't directly hit the infrastructure. Instead, it targeted the business-side computer systems of the private operator, which shut down the pipeline as a precaution.\n\n\"In a case like this, the company itself is the first line of defense and the first line of response to crisis,\" Shortall added.\n\nPlanning for the worst\nThe bloc has several measures in place to ensure it can weather emergency shutdowns.To avoid the kind of fuel shortages and gasoline price increases currently being experienced in parts of the U.S., all EU countries are required under the Oil Stocks Directive to keep at least 90 days’ worth of crude oil or petroleum product imports on hand, or 61 days’ worth of consumption — whichever is greater.\n\nBut it’s not always respected. In December, the European Commission chastised Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech Republic for repeatedly failing to keep the minimum supplies on hand, in some cases going as far back as 2013.\n\nThe good news is that upwards of 80 percent the bloc's crude imports arrive on oil tankers and trucks, according to the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP). Refined products like gasoline and diesel are also transported through the EU by truck and rail, rather than through fixed pipelines — vastly upping flexibility.\n\n\"The EU crude oil pipeline network is a lot less dense — pipe imports of crude are a very small share,\" said Nareg Terzian, EU spokesperson for IOGP. \"It actually makes sense if you think about it: Historically, the oil market has been more liquid and open than the gas one, also because oil is simply much easier to store and transport than gas.\"\n\nNatural gas is a bigger worry for the EU.\n\nFollowing the 2006 and 2009 gas crises, Europe's network of gas transmission system operators has conducted regular simulations of supply interruptions on all EU import pipelines — and prepared rerouting plans using the Continent's system of cross-border interconnectors, underground storage reserves and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.\n\nThe most recent analysis, published in October, simulated winter gas cutoffs of up to two months on three major Russian supply routes: via Finland and down to the Baltic States; via Ukraine; and along the Trans-Balkan pipeline flowing to Romania, Bulgaria and Greece.\n\nIn the Finnish case, the response would be ramping up LNG imports in Lithuania to maximum capacity and tapping Latvia's storage reserves to supply the region. The Baltic connector pipeline — which launched in December 2019 and links Estonia to Finland — would send flows north.\n\nShould the Trans-Balkan pipeline shut down, flows destined for Bulgaria could be sent through the second line of TurkStream, at the Turkish-Bulgarian border.\n\nBut if the Ukrainian route to the EU is hit with a long-term outage in the dead of winter, Romania could be left stranded — even if Russian gas flows are maintained through Belarus and through Germany’s Nord Stream pipeline.\n\n“Romania has no other possibilities to import gas” after its storage stocks are used up, the analysis warns.\n\nThe scenarios don’t account for countries dialing down usage. They also focus more on accidents on individual routes, rather than deliberate shutdowns on multiple routes by a single supplier like Russia.\n\n\"The EU must think long and hard about energy diversification and consider once again the risks of Nord Stream 2, which, if built, will concentrate 80 percent of all Russian gas supplies to Europe to one submarine pipeline system,\" said Sergiy Makogon, CEO of Ukraine's gas grid operator.\n\n\"Digital threats have just come to the fore, but they can’t overshadow physical security,\" Makogon added. \"We have seen mysterious accidents reshape the European energy landscape in 2009, when an unexplained blast destroyed a portion of the Turkmenistan-Russia pipeline, ending exports of Turkmen gas to Europe. Or the 2006 pipeline exposition that left Georgia and Armenia without gas in the middle of winter.\"\n\nThe rise of digital attacks could change the way those scenarios are modeled.\n\n\"Cyber has introduced in the energy sector a new way to think about threats and risks: Better to simulate and stimulate a reaction and to derive a preventive strategy than to have a scenario that will rarely repeat twice on large scale infrastructures,\" ACER's Shortall said.\n\nPolicies in the pipeline\nEuropean companies could soon face tougher cybersecurity rules, when EU legislators pass a proposal by the European Commission to strengthen the NIS regime.\n\nIn the draft law, energy firms risk being fined up to 2 percent of their annual turnover if they don't put in place security audits, have incident response policies and check the security of their suppliers. The proposal also added a range of subsectors of the energy market to the scope of the law, including hydrogen production, district heating, electricity production and central oil stockholding.\n\nThe EU is also working on a \"network code\" on cybersecurity for electricity firms that would be adopted next year; a similar code for gas is also in the works. And the sector is already working with public authorities to share information on attacks and incidents within a European Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\n\n\"The sector is catching up in terms of cybersecurity,\" said Evangelos Ouzounis, head of secure infrastructure and services at ENISA, adding that more investments and continuous information sharing were needed to rule out incidents like the Colonial catastrophe.",

    "content": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has captured for the first time enough light from planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets, to identify molecules in their atmospheres. The landmark achievement is a significant step toward being able to detect possible life on rocky exoplanets and comes years before astronomers had anticipated. \n\n\"This is an amazing surprise,\" said Spitzer project scientist Dr. Michael Werner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"We had no idea when we designed Spitzer that it would make such a dramatic step in characterizing exoplanets.\" \n\nSpitzer, a space-based infrared telescope, obtained the detailed data, called spectra, for two different gas exoplanets. Called HD 209458b and HD 189733b, these so-called \"hot Jupiters\" are, like Jupiter, made of gas, but orbit much closer to their suns. \n\nThe data indicate the two planets are drier and cloudier than predicted. Theorists thought hot Jupiters would have lots of water in their atmospheres, but surprisingly none was found around HD 209458b and HD 189733b. According to astronomers, the water might be present but buried under a thick blanket of high, waterless clouds. \n\nThose clouds might be filled with dust. One of the planets, HD 209458b, showed hints of tiny sand grains, called silicates, in its atmosphere. This could mean the planet's skies are filled with high, dusty clouds unlike anything seen around planets in our own solar system. \n\n\"The theorists' heads were spinning when they saw the data,\" said Dr. Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \n\n\"It is virtually impossible for water, in the form of vapor, to be absent from the planet, so it must be hidden, probably by the dusty cloud layer we detected in our spectrum,\" he said. Richardson is lead author of a Nature paper appearing Feb. 22 that describes a spectrum for HD 209458b. \n\nIn addition to Richardson's team, two other groups of astronomers used Spitzer to capture spectra of exoplanets. A team led by Dr. Carl Grillmair of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif., observed HD 189733b, while a team led by Dr. Mark R. Swain of JPL focused on the same planet in the Richardson study, and came up with similar results. Grillmair's results will be published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Swain's findings have been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters. \n\nA spectrum is created when an instrument called a spectrograph splits light from an object into its different wavelengths, just as a prism turns sunlight into a rainbow. The resulting pattern of light, the spectrum, reveals \"fingerprints\" of chemicals making up the object. \n\nUntil now, the only planets for which spectra were available belonged in our own solar system. The planets in the Spitzer studies orbit stars that are so far away, they are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. HD 189733b is 370 trillion miles away in the constellation Vulpecula, and HD 209458b is 904 trillion miles away in the constellation Pegasus. That means both planets are at least about a million times farther away from us than Jupiter. In the future, astronomers hope to have spectra for smaller, rocky planets beyond our solar system. This would allow them to look for the footprints of life -- molecules key to the existence of life, such as oxygen and possibly even chlorophyll. \n\n\"With these new observations, we are refining the tools that we will one day need to find life elsewhere if it exists,\" said Swain. \"It's sort of like a dress rehearsal.\" \n\nSpitzer was able to tease out spectra from the feeble light of the two planets through what is known as the \"secondary eclipse\" technique. In this method -- first used by Spitzer in 2005 to directly detect the light from an exoplanet for the first time -- a so-called transiting planet is monitored as it circles behind its star, temporarily disappearing from our Earthly point of view. By measuring the dip in infrared light that occurs when the planet disappears, Spitzer can learn how much light is coming solely from the planet. The technique will work only in infrared wavelengths, where the planet is brighter than in visible wavelengths and stands out better next to the overwhelming glare of its star. \n\nIn the new studies, Spitzer's spectrograph, which measures infrared light at a range of wavelengths, stared at the two transiting planets as they orbited their stars. This allowed the astronomers to subtract the spectra of the stars from the spectra of the planets plus their stars to obtain spectra of the planets alone. \n\n\"When we first set out to make these observations, they were considered high risk because not many people thought they would work,\" said Grillmair. \"But Spitzer has turned out to be superbly designed and more than up to the task.\" \n\nPrevious observations of HD 209458b by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope revealed individual elements, such as sodium, oxygen, carbon and hydrogen, that bounce around the very top of the planet, a region higher up than that probed in the Spitzer studies and a region where molecules like water would break apart. To do this, Hubble measured changes in the light from the star, not the planet, as the planet passed in front. The observations indicated less sodium than predicted, which again supports the idea that the planet is socked in with high clouds. \n\nAstronomers hope to use Spitzer for additional studies of transiting exoplanets, which are those that cross in front of their stars from our point view. Of the approximately 200 known exoplanets, 14 are transiting. At least three of these in addition to HD 209458b and HD 189733b are candidates for obtaining spectra. Further spectral studies of HD 209458b and HD 189733b will also yield more information about the planets' atmospheres. \n\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages the Spitzer Space Telescope mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. Science operations are conducted at the Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, also in Pasadena. Caltech manages JPL for NASA. Spitzer's infrared spectrograph was built by Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. Its development was led by Dr. Jim Houck of Cornell.",

    "content": "“The soldier was about 40m away. He looked at me and fired,” said Christopher Madrid, pointing to the patch above his right eye. “I swung away and the bullet grazed [my forehead] and came out, left a scar of four or five centimetres.”\n\nMadrid, a 25-year-old student, was shot last Monday by Chilean army troops as he marched in a street protest near the Catholic University in central Santiago.\n\n“Lots of people were going down with head wounds,” explained Madrid as he waited impatiently in Posta Central, a dilapidated health clinic where dozens of gunshot victims were being treated, including a close friend, shot three times in the head and once in the leg with “balines” – marble-sized bullets that are rarely fatal but can puncture a lung or take out an eye.\n\nHospital beds at Posta Central are usually filled with victims of traffic accidents and life-threatening cases of influenza, but the week-long Chilean uprising – the most serious unrest since the fall of Augusto Pinochet – has sent hundreds to the hospital with gunshot and head wounds and head fractures, and left at least 19 dead nationwide. Hospital staff at Posta Central are now working 24-hour shifts because a strict military curfew has thousands of soldiers patrolling the streets from late evening until dawn, making it dangerous and difficult for hospital staff to commute.President Sebastián Piñera had declared that the authorities “are at war” with those who are marching, but yesterday he announced a cabinet reshuffle and said he would ease the military-enforced curfew. “I have put all my ministers on notice in order to restructure my cabinet to confront these new demands,” Piñera told reporters from the La Moneda presidential palace.\n\nThe lack of basic medical treatment for the largely working-class victims of gunshot wounds was notable inside Posta Central, as staff described shortages of supplies in the public health facilities and emphasised the gulf between services at this run-down structure and the gleaming private clinics just 10km away.\n\nPatients at Posta Central were dying, workers said, due to the lack of basic supplies, including surgical gloves, syringes and masks. A dearth of small flasks for blood samples means patients go days without having blood work done, even in the 24-bed intensive care unit. Resources are so limited that physicians and nurses must decide whether to withhold supplies for patients near death in favour of those with a better chance of survival.In a desperate effort to save patients’ lives, nurses and respiratory specialists cannibalise various devices as they patch and weave together trachea filters. “It’s a product that costs 40,000 pesos [£43] but we don’t have many, so people are inventing the best they can,” said one professional who asked not to be named for fear of being blacklisted by the Chilean public health establishment. Recently assigned to Posta, he said that at least one patient a week was dying unnecessarily, due in large part to the lack of basic equipment.One professional recounted a recent incident in which a patient at Posta Central had died. The doctor turned and walked to the charts. A detail on the patient’s chart shocked him: the patient was married with children. Surprised, he turned around and said to a colleague: “Oh. I thought he was indigent.” The lack of empathy for working-class patients is reflected in the attitude of the health minister Jaime Mañalich, who on national TV mocked the upheaval as just “a march” and who has repeatedly sabotaged attempts to record the number of gunshot wounds inflicted by security forces.\n\n“From the first moment, the hospital directors refused to provide information. Our [medical] colleagues have, in part, been intimidated not to provide information,” said Izkia Siches, president of the Chilean Medical Association. “There is a substantial under-reporting of the injured and also a lack of counselling for many of these [victims] to denounce the violation of their rights.” Siches demanded that Mañalich release the full figures and break what she called an “information blackout”.\n\nThe controversy over the extent of shootings during protests has engulfed Posta Central as the deputy director, Luis Carrasco, banned human rights observers from entering the facility, then sent staff to buy heavy padlocks to further limit access. Carrasco, who spent years working as head of surgery at the National Police Hospital, appeared to be hostile to the idea of releasing statistics about the number of protesters shot by military and police forces.\n\nAlthough the official figure stands at 470 people shot, that number does little to illuminate the stinging drama of individual shootings. In the packed waiting room at Posta, groups of anguished protesters monitor injured friends. Shooting victims clad in bloodsoaked T-shirts, thick white bandages on their heads, wait to have bullets removed. Others carry deep gashes after being hit by metal teargas canisters blasted into crowds by riot police.“I was observing an incident in the subway stop – protestors were battling the police, and to dissuade them, the police began to shoot the protestors,” said Camilo Rojas, 30, who is studying for a degree in tourism. “They then started shooting the people who were watching higher up. Fortunately, I had my backpack as a shield, and this helped me. I put my backpack in front of me – otherwise it might have hit my head.” A second bullet shattered his watch and Outside the waiting room, groups of law students from the University of Chile gather statistics and case histories for the shooting victims.\n\n“There was a journalism student who was beaten so badly she could not talk, or remember her name. Her whole body was bruised after being kicked and clubbed,” said Felipe Hernández, a law student. “We had a woman yesterday with a broken jaw – the soldiers broke it with a rifle butt.”\n\nChilean TV news broadcasts have so censored images that the stations have been surrounded by angry crowds. The once esteemed Televisión Nacional de Chile was forced to protect its headquarters with platoons of heavily armed soldiers to prevent protesters from seizing their broadcast facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, in the streets the shootings continue unabated. “So many protesters are being shot in the eye,” a healthcare worker told the Chilean investigative news site CIPER. At the eye trauma unit of Posta Central, where protesters with eye injuries are taken, “the situation is atrocious,” she said. “Many patients have their eyes shattered. We have never had so many ruptured eyes at once. The rubber bullets and the buckshot don’t kill, but they pierce the eye. All the patients have a poor chance of regaining vision. Many eyes have been lost.”",

    "content": "SAN BERNARDINO, California — A Southern California woman has officially become the 59th victim of the Route 91 Harvest festival massacre in Las Vegas, nearly three years after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nOn Friday, a San Bernardino County medical examiner attributed the Nov. 15 death of Kimberly Gervais, 57, to complications of the spinal injuries she suffered in the shooting, according to Mike Sutcliffe, a supervising deputy coroner investigator for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. The ruling comes more than nine months after her death at the Redlands Community Hospital in Southern California.\n\nBut the Metropolitan Police Department is not increasing the official death toll.\n\n“The number is not going to change,” spokesman Larry Hadfield said Monday.\n\nHe declined to elaborate on the department’s decision, though he added, “I think they have to look at everything a little bit more. That’s the answer as it stands right now.”Fifty-eight people were initially killed and hundreds more were injured in the shooting, which unfolded on the final night of Route 91, a three-day country music festival on the south end of the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nNeither Las Vegas police nor the FBI could determine a motive for the shooting. The gunman killed himself.The last of the 58 victims was pronounced dead on Oct. 3, 2017, and the official death toll has not been raised since then.\n\nAt the time of Gervais’ death, the department said any changes to the death toll would be dependent on the woman’s official cause and manner of death.\n\nI want her to be remembered’\n\n“I feel like I can finally take a deep breath,” said the woman’s oldest daughter, Amber Manka, who was unaware that a ruling by the San Bernardino county coroner had been made until a Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter called her on Monday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview a day earlier in Corona, California, Manka said not knowing for more than nine months whether her mother would be considered the 59th victim had been isolating in some ways.\n\n“Of course I want her to be remembered,” Manka said Sunday as the shooting’s third anniversary approached. “But I’m very cautious of not wanting to harm the other 58 families in some way if they feel a certain way about it.”\n\nManka could not be reached Monday evening for comment on Metro’s decision to leave the death toll unchanged.\n\nGervais was left quadriplegic from a bullet that lodged in her C7 vertebra during the mass shooting on Oct. 1, 2017. Shrapnel had scattered from shoulder to shoulder, and for the next two years Gervais was in and out of hospitals and treatment centers, according to Manka.\n\nIn an interview at his office on Monday, Sutcliffe explained the delay in reaching conclusions about the death, which was ruled a homicide.\n\n“In a general sense, when we’re looking at remote gunshot wound cases, there are typically other intervening medical problems that can complicate the actual cause of death,” he said. “So even though there were a bunch of other injuries and conditions, none of those things would have occurred if not for the original injury.”Sutcliffe said the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department had been in contact with both Metro and the Clark County coroner’s office since Gervais’ death. The Sheriff’s Department reached out to Metro on Friday afternoon about its ruling but had not heard from Las Vegas police as of late Monday morning.\n\n“Our position in this particular case is that it’s only our case by happenstance,” Sutcliffe said. “Our approach to this case was that while she may have passed away in our jurisdiction, which gave us primary authority over the autopsy, it’s still a Las Vegas Metro case.”\n\n‘Superhuman strength’\n\nGervais, a lifelong country music fan, attended Route 91 with her friends Dana Smith and Pati Mestas, one of the original 58 victims.\n\nWhen the gunfire erupted during headliner Jason Aldean’s set, Gervais suddenly dropped to the ground. Two men ran to her side and, using an American flag bandana, pressed on her wound to control the bleeding.\n\nMoments later, one of the men was shot in the leg as he knelt beside Gervais. According to Manka, had the stranger not stopped to help her mother, that bullet would have struck Gervais in the head.\n\nThe men used a piece of a broken fence to carry Gervais, who was unable to move her legs and arms, out of the concert grounds.\n\nShe spent the next two weeks in the ICU at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, a hospital stay that would set the tone for the next two years of her life.\n\nGervais, once a fiercely independent woman who spent her weekends riding quads in the California desert, now relied on a wheelchair and depended on her two daughters to complete everyday tasks: brushing her teeth, eating, bathing.\n\nYet, Manka has said, her mother displayed “superhuman strength” during the last two years of life. She fought until the end, even surviving two near-death instances during a hospital stay last June, according to Manka.Gervais was laid to rest last month just outside her hometown of Kansas City, in the small Missouri town of Malta Bend, where her grandmother’s family once owned a farm.\n\nContact Rio Lacanlale at rlacanlale@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0381.

    "content": "All is not well in the world of pocket monsters. The official Pokémon Twitter account is getting inundated with angry fans. The latest gameplay footage for Pokémon Sword and Shield is getting massively downvoted on YouTube. The Pokémon subreddit is full of concerned threads, some vowing to not buy the upcoming game at all. For a little while, a hashtag was even trending on social media: #bringbacknationaldex.The hashtag refers to an ongoing Pokémon feature where players are allowed to have a full Pokedex of monsters once they’ve beaten the main game. Whenever there’s a new set of games, they introduce new monsters, and the title will limit you to that repertoire to help you get to know the new cast. But this is only temporary. Eventually, you can import your full collection to the game in question.\n\nNot so in Pokémon Sword and Shield. As we reported earlier this week, producer Junichi Masuda said that only Pokémon from the Galar region will be available in Sword and Shield. According to Masuda, the ever-growing list of Pokémon — which now includes over 800 creatures — coupled with the features of the Nintendo Switch, made importing all monsters into the new games a tough task. The aim was to represent the collection with “much higher fidelity with higher quality animations” than we’ve previously seen before, Masuda told USGamer. Some familiar faces will be back, as every new region includes older Pokémon. But the Galar region will only be home to Galar Pokémon.\n\nMasuda’s comments instantly displeased Pokémon fans. Part of the issue is that Masuda’s explanation doesn’t quite make sense, at least on its face. He speaks of improved animations, but Pokémon games have always presented limited movement when on the battlefield. To wit, one of the viral Tweets floating around presents the dichotomy between what Masuda says, and what the games actually show:The issue with this line of thinking is that we don’t actually know what animations Masuda is referring to. For all we know, the extended animations might be in reference to Pokémon Amie, which allows us to pet and pamper our favorite buddies. An increasingly convincing leak of Pokemon Sword and Shield states that the upcoming game will allow you to camp with your Pokémon, and while doing so, you’ll be able to play with them, and cook and feed them curry. As camping didn’t exist in previous games, it’s possible the bespoke animations Masuda is talking about aren’t in battles — that’s never been where Pokémon places its animation resources in the first place.\n\nAnother part of the narrative that is fueling this backlash comes from the hacking scene, which is well acquainted with how Pokémon games are built. As hackers tell it, the in-game models are being reused from previous games.This, of course, is difficult to confirm — but it’s definitely influencing a lot of the angry rhetoric I’ve seen floating around. But again, even if it’s reused models, that doesn’t account for the time needed to make hundreds of new animations for new features. Beyond the potential camping mechanic, we’ve also got Dynamaxing, as well as whatever else hasn’t been shown off yet. People are working with limited information at the moment.Perhaps this seems like an entitled response, but a lot of it has to do with Pokémon’s ongoing identity. At one point, the franchise tagline was “gotta catch ‘em all.” While this phrase still occasionally appears, overall, it’s been retired as the official tagline. Even so, players still approach Pokémon in that way. People love to hunt down complete collections, spending endless hours tracking down rare monsters. Others spend ages hunting shiny Pokémon. And when you’ve been able to transfer your collection from game to game for years now, it means that you start forming attachment to these digital creatures. Each monster has a history. People don’t want to lose that.\n\nPart of the dissonance here is that Game Freak, the developers, encourage this type of approach to the games. Hardcore players pay for the privilege of putting their monsters in the cloud, to preserve them for future games. For some, it feels like a slap in the face to pay for something you won’t be able to use in the latest games.So, to some degree, the backlash makes sense: People have spent years playing Pokémon in a specific way, and it’s built up an expectation to be able to do exactly that forever. Criticism and disappointment was inevitable. But, in some ways, the backlash has gotten out of hand. Many miffed players are calling Game Freak “lazy” for not bringing the entire compendium of 800 monsters into Sword and Shield, which is a wild thing to say.\n\nThere is no such thing as a lazy game developer. Even disappointing or “bad” games are often a labor of love and crunch. I believe Masuda when he says that animating all 800-plus monsters is hard work. I mean, look at the battle animations that are being skewered right now: Yes, Scorbunny’s attack is just a stock animation. But Scorbunny still has a specific hopping idling animation that unfolds while this attack occurs. That animation must have taken time and effort, and it’s not a resource that can be reused for any other non-bunny monster.\n\nThe problem isn’t laziness. The problem, if you can call it that, is a difference in priorities. If Game Freak thought it was important to have the entire Pokédex available in the Galar region, it would do exactly that. Instead, the developer seems to be putting its focus on other portions of the game. We know that Sword and Shield will have raids, an open world, extended online capabilities, and a 3D camera, all in addition to improved graphics. So we know that Game Freak is putting in the effort to make a good game, that effort just isn’t going where fans want it to go. This gap makes it easy for people to put down Game Freak’s existing vision for the game.\n\nRight now, fans are making a fuss in the hopes of grabbing Game Freak’s attention and convincing them to change course. It might not work — Masuda says there are currently no plans to change the compendium via future updates. But unless something changes, we’re probably going to see discourse about the missing National Dex up until the release of Sword and Shield.",

    "content": "France, despite its reputation as a beacon of progressive liberalism, has been at the forefront of a burgeoning pan-European far-right movement.\n\nMarine Le Pen, an anti-immigration Eurosceptic who may well top the first round of France's presidential election on 23 April, is riding a populist insurgency that has been growing over the past 15 years.\n\nIts themes are familiar in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit: concern for hardworking people, support for traditional values, and opposition to immigration and supranational busybodies.\n\nBut the most distinctive characteristic of France's patriotic surge is youth. Unlike their contemporaries in the US and the UK, the under-30s in France are more nationalistic than the general population.\n\nAt the radical end of the movement are the \"identitaires\", or identitarians - the equivalent of the American alt-right.\n\nWho are the identitarians?\nTheir standard bearers are Génération Identitaire (GI), a group that specialises in publicity stunts that it films and posts online to advertise its fight to reclaim French territory said to have been lost to foreign migrants.GI has 120,000 Facebook fans - almost twice as many as the youth wings of the Socialist Party and the centre-right Republicans combined.\n\nUnlike the skinheads of old, the group sticks to non-violence. The iPhone, it has found, is mightier than the boot.Following a group of activists handing out flyers in Paris, however, it is clear that they relish verbal confrontation. Their leader Pierre Larti, 26, stands surrounded by a group of North African men.\n\n\"When I read this leaflet I understand that you don't want me here,\" one says.\n\n\"What we don't want is the replacement of our values by Islamic ones,\" replies Mr Larti. \"France is historically a Christian country. I'm not criticising anyone. What happens in your land is your business. What happens here is ours. We are against colonisation, and this is why we don't want the same phenomenon to happen in reverse.\"Oddly, perhaps, for a group passionately attached to national differences, GI is sprouting branches across Europe. But identitarians see the whole continent as a battleground between European and Islamic culture.\n\nJean-Yves Le Gallou, a former Euro-MP, speaks of a struggle for \"civilisational\" identity. \"Whether you are Dutch, German or French,\" he says, \"you have the same problem and have the same view of the world.\"\n\nMr Le Gallou, 69, has produced a video entitled Being European (\"Europe is not a globalised, borderless space. Europe is not African or Muslim territory.\") that has been viewed more than 3.2m times on YouTube in less than two years - three times as many as Being French, a sister video extolling his homeland.\n\nMr Le Gallou's website, Polemia, stands at the high-brow end of France's identitarian spectrum. In the 1970s, he was a leading member of the Nouvelle Droite, an influential group of far-right thinkers.\n\nHis continued influence is testament to the deep intellectual roots of the identitarian movement.\n\nIt also highlights the power of new media. Without the internet, Mr Le Gallou and others would have no mass audience. Their warnings against the \"Great Replacement\" of locals by immigrants are no-go areas for mainstream journalists.\n\nSpreading the message online\nShut out by traditional media, identitarians have thrived on the web over the past decade. One of the online stars is Fdesouche, a news aggregator that features links to articles and clips from mainstream sites selected to chronicle chaos in migrant suburbs.\n\nFdesouche offers no comment, but leaves readers to draw their own conclusions: Islamists and \"racaille\" (\"rabble\" - code for dark-skinned criminals) are threatening to take over the country, one housing estate at a time.\n\nFdesouche gets about 3m views per month, dwarfing the websites of mainstream politicians. Emmanuel Macron, a centrist with a devoted following of hipsters, manages less than 1m.Fdesouche's success has spawned a swarm of imitators and rivals.\n\nIs France's online far right a threat to democracy?\n\nOften collectively called the \"fachosphère\" (from \"fascist\"), websites denouncing mass immigration and Islam have seen spectacular growth in France over the past 10 years. And France's cyber-patriots are a diverse lot.One fault line divides new-model identitarians, who view Muslims as the main threat, from traditionalists who believe the chief malevolent force in the world is \"Zionism\".\n\nThe most prominent anti-Zionist is Alain Soral. His website, Égalité et Reconciliation (E&R), weaves nationalist and left-wing themes by calling for solidarity with people from poor countries.\n\nSoral rejects accusations of \"anti-Semitism\". He sees a clear distinction between \"ordinary Jews\" and what he calls the organised Jewish lobby, which he says is persecuting him.\n\nHe sympathises with native French people, but feels identitarians are focusing on the wrong target. By \"inciting poor whites to turn against blacks and Muslims\" they were doing the work of Zionists, he told the BBC.Alain Soral is regularly prosecuted for incitement. But he is no bit-part player. E&R has more readers than Fdesouche, and by some measures is France's most popular political website.\n\nVarious parts of the online alt-right may be firing from different directions, but their target is the same: the political and media establishment.\n\nSuch resentment is not the preserve of the identitarian fringe, or of people languishing in neglected provinces.\n\nOpposition to liberal elites and concern about the disappearance of borders are widespread, and increasingly being aired in the heart of Paris.\n\nAt Sciences Po, an institution that trains the next generation of government and business leaders. Eurosceptic students have set up a club, \"Critique of European Reason\" (CRE), to wage the fight where it matters.\n\nIts leader, Nicolas Pouvreau, says the group has managed to \"create a Eurosceptic safe space in an environment that remains hostile.\"\n\nAnother member, Sarah Knafo, says the rising popularity of Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) - France's largest party - has earned the group a grudging respect on campus: \"We represent something bigger than us, and people dare not despise us as much as they used to.\"\n\nLast year's Brexit vote in the UK thrilled CRE members. The next morning they gathered outside the UK embassy to drink champagne and sing God Save the Queen.\n\nAnti-white racism\nBeyond hostility to the EU, CRE members regard uncontrolled migration and trade flows as a source of social disintegration.\n\nIt would be wrong to label Critique of European Reason as far-right. The group brings together one-nation activists from both the left and the right who have much more in common with one another than with the moderates in their respective camps.Kevin, another CRE student who supports hard-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is as hostile to multiculturalism as the conservatives within the group.\n\nHaving lived in an immigrant banlieue (suburb) he says he has often been called \"dirty white\", and says the mainstream press denies the reality of \"anti-white racism\".\n\nUnfashionable as they are, these feelings are widespread among those who have left the banlieues.\n\n\"I have suffered from being white,\" says Ugo Iannuzzi, a Sorbonne student.\n\n\"I have often cried. I used to go to school with fear in my stomach. You start to feel bad about being white, about being French and loving your origins because you get beaten up, your phone gets stolen and glasses smashed.\"\n\nMr Iannuzzi supports the FN. But his resentment of the political and media elites mirrors that of left-wingers like Mr Vercin.\n\nLost generation\nAlexandre Devecchio, a journalist and author of a book on various tribes of young French rebels, calls all those preoccupied with the erosion of identity the \"Zemmour generation\". Eric Zemmour is an influential writer-broadcaster who argues that the 1968 revolt has led France to ruin.\n\nMany of today's twentysomethings, Mr Devecchio argues, agree with Zemmour because they feel let down. Born after the fall of the Berlin Wall, they were expected to blossom in an open, rainbow society within a pacified, post-historical Europe.\n\n\"For that generation, reality did not follow the script,\" Mr Devecchio told the BBC. What they have experienced is unemployment, insecure jobs, and a sense of physical and cultural insecurity in areas where radical Islam is on the rise, he believes.\n\nCould the identitarians and the wider Zemmour generation help Marine Le Pen win power?\n\nAt the moment that appears unlikely. Ms Le Pen lacks the backing of a major party, and is expected to be defeated by any second-round opponent.\n\nBut she can draw comfort from the fact that polls have underestimated the support of other populist leaders.\n\nHigh abstention levels could also help her. The instinct to rally around whoever runs against the FN is much weaker now than in the past. Polls suggest that half the voters backing hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon would either abstain or back Ms Le Pen in a second round against Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAnd should she lose the race, the setback could be temporary if her victorious opponent fails to bring about reform.\n\nIdentitarianism feeds on pessimism. The country's patriotic rebels are young and may have time on their side.",

    "content": "Marine archaeologists believe they have identified the wreck of the Japanese aircraft carrier the Akagi, which was sunk during the second world war’s battle of Midway, regarded by some historians as one of the most consequential naval engagements in history.\n\nIn the space of a week naval historians with the research vessel Petrel announced that they had discovered the remains of two of the four Japanese carriers that were sunk during the battle. The team’s efforts had concentrated on identifying all of the vessels sunk during the June 1942 engagement that cost the lives of 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans.\n\nThe expedition’s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high-frequency sonar images of the warship on Sunday before asserting that its dimensions and location meant it had to be the carrier Akagi.The Akagi was found in 5,490 metres (18,011 ft) of water and more than 1,300 miles (2,090km) north-west of Pearl Harbor.\n\nA high-frequency sonar image of the wreck site, taken by the research vessel’s underwater drone, shows the huge carrier lying broken on the sea bed amid debris, but otherwise remarkably intact.\n\n“I’m sure of what we’re seeing here, the dimensions that we’re able to derive from this image (are) conclusive,” Kraft said. “It can be none other than Akagi.”\n\n“She’s sitting upright on her keel, we can see the bow, we can see the stern clearly, you can see some of the gun emplacements on there, you can see that some of the flight deck is also torn up and missing so you can actually look right into where the flight deck would be,” said Kraft.\n\nThe 33,000-tonne ship was first laid down as a heavy battlecruiser but quickly converted into a carrier, serving as the flagship for V-Adm Chūichi Nagumo during the surprise attack on the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, and the raids on Darwin and Colombo.\n\nA year later, ordered to engage and destroy the US carrier threat in the Pacific, Japanese forces settled on the invasion and occupation of Midway atoll as a lure, an action that would change the course of the war in the Pacific.\n\nFought largely at the operating limits of the two carrier fleets’ aircraft, and with errors made on both sides, the Japanese were unaware the US navy had broken its codes and underestimated the forces Americans could muster.An unsuccessful attack by waves of US torpedo bombers was followed by attacks by US dive bombers which struck the Kaga first and then the Akagi, forcing the damaged flagship to be scuttled with Japanese torpedoes after the loss of 267 men.\n\nThe battle saw Japan lose almost two-thirds of its fleet’s aircraft carriers and many of its most experienced fliers, a setback from which the country – lacking the industrial base of the US, not least in steel production – would never recover.\n\nThe discovery of the Akagi comes hard on the heels of the Kaga, last week, sunk by the same dive bombers from the USS Enterprise who would sink the Akagi.\n\n“We read about the battles, we know what happened. But when you see these wrecks on the bottom of the ocean and everything, you kind of get a feel for what the real price is for war,” said Thompson, who is onboard the Petrel.\n\n“You see the damage these things took, and it’s humbling to watch some of the video of these vessels because they’re war graves.”\n\nThe expedition is an effort launched by the late Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft. For years, the crew of the 76-metre (250ft) Petrel has worked with the US navy and other officials around the world to locate and document sunken ships. It has found more than 30 vessels so far.",

The coast guard said on Wednesday that interested parties should not help with the cleaning activities as there are three unlocalized containers ​that could contain hazardous materials.\n\nAccording to the latest update from Germany’s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (Havariekommando), some of the containers that went overboard have already been spotted, including six in German waters. However, it is yet to be determined whether a container with dangerous goods had been among those that went overboard.\n\n“MSC has started a clean-up operation in response to a substantial spill of containers in the North Sea,” MSC said in a statement today.\n\n“Unfortunately, a number of the containers were damaged or lost overboard amid very difficult conditions.”\n\nThe Swiss-based containership owner has appointed a salvage company to coordinate the retrieval of cargo and beach clean-up operations and is also deploying specialised ships equipped with sonar to search for missing cargo at sea.\n\n“MSC takes this incident very seriously, both in terms of the impact of such accidents on the natural environment and in terms of any damage to customers’ cargo. In all aspects of the clean-up MSC is collaborating with local authorities,” the company added.\n\n“MSC will ensure that customers who seek further information receive direct communications in the coming days. They are invited to contact local MSC representatives.”\n\nMSC Zoe proceeded to Bremerhaven for cargo discharge operations. The German authorities said that the ship moored at Bremerhaven at 00:35 this morning after being accompanied to the port by the multipurpose vessel Neuwerk.\n\nMSC said it was analyzing the causes of the incident.",

    "content": "Malaysia has arrested more than 4,000 people for violating virus lockdown orders, marking the toughest law enforcement action in Southeast Asia after the Philippines, where the president encourages police to shoot offenders.\n\nMalaysia is entering what it calls a “harsh mode” or a harsher phase of its official Movement Control Order to keep citizens in isolation and curb the spread of coronavirus, which threatens both the economy and human rights.\n\nPolice set up hundreds of roadblocks, have been conducting inspections, and have arrested thousands, including one man who jumped into the Strait of Malacca to avoid arrest, according to the government news service Bernama.\n\n“At first, the police enforcement was done in the soft and advisory mode, then it changed into the stern mode, and now it has entered the harsh mode,” Bernama quoted Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, the senior minister for security, as saying at a press conference Thursday. “So I hope the people will adhere to the MCO.”\n\nLockdown enforcement around the world has ranged from Florida charging a pastor who violated orders against mass gatherings, to Australia fining citizens who gather in groups of two or more.\n\nBut Malaysia reports one of the highest arrest rates, with 4,189 people arrested for loitering since March 18, including 1,449 charged in court. The rate is higher in the Philippines, where police arrested more than 20,000 lockdown violators, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said to “shoot them dead” if needed.\n\nMalaysia said its lockdown is decreasing the spread of COVID-19. It has reported 3,116 total cases and 50 deaths as of Friday.\n\nGoogle published data showing how much mobility has changed in each nation amid lockdown, using cell phone data. Malaysia saw the presence of citizens at retail and recreation sites decrease by 81% on Sunday, compared with about a month earlier, according to Google.\n\nThe law enforcement actions have included a crackdown on speech, however, that activists worry could threaten human rights, as the former ruling party that ran Malaysia for all except two years of its modern history returns to power.In addition to lockdown violators, the authorities have arrested people for allegedly spreading misinformation online about the virus. Journalists say they are self-censoring news about the virus to avoid punishment from the government.\n\n“Human rights workers, free expression advocates, bloggers, software developers, and activists are all in danger when government uses leeway obtained during a crisis to curtail free expression far beyond what’s required,” said Jason Kelley, a digital strategist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for an open internet.\n\nHe noted in a blog post that Malaysia is among several governments arresting people for alleged misinformation, and he says many of those arrested are activists.\n\nEconomists say the political turmoil in Kuala Lumpur will make it hard for the government to fight the coronavirus. Mahathir Mohamad, who became prime minister again in 2018 thanks mostly to the 1MDB corruption scandal that sank the prior regime, tried to consolidate power in February. His failure caused a political crisis until the old ruling party stepped into the power vacuum in March.\n\nWith the old party back in power, the government has started to stabilize, but the virus is still threatening the economy. Malaysia is one of the first three economies in the region, in addition to Singapore and Thailand, to predict a recession this year because of the coronavirus.\n\nIn response, the government announced last week the “People's Economic Stimulus Package,” locally abbreviated as PRIHATIN, to deal with COVID-19. The package includes $57.3 billion worth of cash aid, loans, deferred taxes and debt payments, along with other aid.\n\n“The sheer size of PRIHATIN signals the seriousness and sincerity in the government's approach,” said Jason Liang and Krystal Ng, partners at law firm Wong & Partners, in a joint assessment. “These measures ought to be far-reaching and should provide a source of encouragement and relief.”",

    "content": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that this Atlantic hurricane season will be more active than usual, according to a statement released on Thursday.\n\nWhile NOAA does not expect this hurricane season to reach the historic levels of 2020, which saw a record-breaking 30 named storms, forecasters predict between 13 and 20 named storms with up to five major hurricanes. Hurricane season begins on June 1 and peaks in the fall, so NOAA will update its forecast in August, says NOAA seasonal hurricane forecaster Matthew Rosencrans to NPR’s Laurel Wamsley.\n\nThe announcement comes a month after NOAA raised the definition of an “average” Atlantic hurricane season from 12 named storms to 14 named storms.\n\nThere is a 60 percent chance that 2021 will see an above-average hurricane season, which would be the sixth above-average hurricane season in a row, reports CNN’s Allison Chinchar. In April, Colorado State University meteorologists released their prediction of an above-average hurricane season as well.\n\n\"The primary reasons why we're going above average is the low likelihood of a significant El Niño event and the relative warmth in the tropical (Atlantic) but especially the subtropical eastern Atlantic,\" says Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert at Colorado State University, to CNN.\n\nEl Niño events reduce hurricanes because they bring increased vertical wind shear, which means that wind speed and direction changes more dramatically at different heights in the atmosphere. Without that effect paring down the number of storms, it is possible that the Atlantic could see between six and ten hurricanes, with windspeeds over 74 miles per hour, and between three to five major storms with winds over 111 miles per hour.“Now is the time to ensure that you have an evacuation plan in place, disaster supplies on hand, and a plan to secure your home quickly,” said acting NOAA Administrator Benjamin Friedman during a press briefing on Thursday, per the Verge’s Justine Calma. “It was a mere six months ago that the most active Atlantic season on record ended, and here we are now on the cusp of a new hurricane season.”\n\nThe last Atlantic hurricane season was particularly active because of a La Niña weather event, which has ended. Although 2021 may mark the sixth above-average hurricane season in the Atlantic, the way that storms have become more common has not been directly connected with climate change.\n\n“Climate change has not been linked to the frequency of storms but is has been linked to the intensity of storms,” says Matthew Rosencrans, head of forecasting for the U.S. National Weather Service, to Reuters’ Erwin Seba. Hurricanes’ strength and the level of destruction, like that caused by slow-moving storms Hurricane Havey and Hurricane Sally, has been linked to climate change.\n\nRosencrans tells NPR, “Most of the increase in storms is really a reflection of the better technology to detect the storms.”\n\nMore sensitive equipment has improved meteorologists’ ability to spot storms in the middle of the Atlantic and measure their windspeed. For instance, NOAA uses aircraft called hurricane hunters to measure air pressure, humidity, temperature and wind speed and direction in storms.As of Friday, the National Hurricane Center already had its eye on what may be the first named Atlantic storm of 2021, that is developing northeast of Bermuda, per the Weather Channel. The first named storm of 2021 will be called Ana, and the second will be named Bill.",

Rahman. Another long-weekend crowd pleaser was British singer-songwriter Sami Yusuf, who was joined by musicians from around the world for his ‘Beyond the Stars’ show.\n\nIraqi megastar Kadim Al Sahir kickstarted Expo 2020 Dubai’s spectacular Infinite Nights series. Also popular was a performance from Syrian composer, songwriter and producer Iyad Rimawi, who took to the Jubilee Stage as part of the Late Nights @ Expo series.\n\nRegular events such as night-time light festival Kaleidoscope have proven hugely popular, as have the Expo 2020 Water Feature, with its 14-meter-high walls of water, and the Garden in the Sky, which gives visitors a 360-degree view of the Expo site.\n\nOrganizers said visitors have also flocked to more than 200 food and beverage outlets across the site for the chance to sample more than 50 global cuisines, ranging from street food to innovative culinary technology and sustainable dining.\n\nContinuing to bring Expo 2020 Dubai to a global digital audience, the number of virtual visitors has risen to 10.8 million since 1 October, up from 9.3 million last week.\n\nRunning until 31 March 2022, Expo 2020 has invited visitors from across the planet to join the making of a new world in a six-month celebration of human creativity, innovation, progress and culture.",
