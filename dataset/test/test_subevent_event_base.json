    "content": "he European Commission has today adopted a positive assessment of Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. This is an important step towards the EU disbursing €13.9 billion in grants and €2.7 billion in loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) over the period 2021-2026. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Portugal to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe RRF - at the heart of NextGenerationEU - will provide up to €672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Portuguese plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market.\n\nThe Commission assessed Portugal's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms contained in Portugal's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience.\n\nSecuring Portugal's green and digital transition  \n\nThe Commission's assessment finds that Portugal's plan devotes 38% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes investments to finance a large-scale renovation programme to increase the energy efficiency of buildings or the promotion of energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources in industrial processes.\n\nThe Commission finds that the Portugal's plan devotes 22% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. This includes efforts to digitalise the public administration and to modernise the computer systems of the National Health Service, as well as technological laboratories in secondary schools and professional training centres.\n\nReinforcing Portugal's economic and social resilience\n\nThe Commission considers that Portugal's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Portugal by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures in the areas of accessibility and resilience of social services and the health system, labour market, education and skills, R&D and innovation, climate and digital transition, business environment, quality and sustainability of public finances and efficiency of the justice system.\n\nThe plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Portugal's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation.\n\nSupporting flagship investment and reform projects\n\nPortugal's plan proposes projects in six European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects, which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the green and digital transition. For instance, Portugal has proposed to provide €610 million to renovate public and private buildings to improve their energy performance. This will result in Portugal reducing its energy bill, greenhouse gas emissions and energy dependence, as well as reducing energy poverty.\n\nThe assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation.\n\nThe control systems put in place by Portugal are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: “Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Portugal's €16.6 billion recovery and resilience plan, the first to be endorsed by the Commission. The plan was designed in Portugal. The reforms and investments contained in this plan will allow Portugal to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the future. In short, it will help build a better future for the Portuguese people. We will stand by Portugal every step of the way. Your success will be our success. A European success.”\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: “Portugal was the first country to present its plan and today we are happy to confirm our positive assessment. This is a solid plan that will put Portugal on a path of higher growth, create new jobs for the future as well as stronger and sustainable social protection. The proposed measures cover a broad spectrum of reforms and investments to equip Portugal for the green and digital transition, ranging from digitalising the public administration, improving workers' skills, creating energy-efficient housing, to better protecting the country's vast forests. I also welcome the plan's strong social focus, including measures to improve childcare and strengthen the health care system. This plan will allow Portugal to grow back stronger. We will now work closely with Portugal on its full implementation.”\n\nPaolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: “The reforms and investments included in the Portuguese plan will enhance the country's resilience and give a strong boost to its climate transition and digital transformation efforts. With its measures to support social services, the national health service and education and training, the plan also has a very strong social dimension. This is our first completed assessment of a national recovery and resilience plan, marking a key milestone in the implementation of NextGenerationEU. And it is fitting that the first plan to be assessed positively is Portugal's: not only because it was the first to be submitted, but also because the Portuguese Presidency played such a key role in putting in place the legal and financial framework for this unprecedented common European endeavour.”\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide €13.9 billion in grants and €2.7 billion in loans to Portugal under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal.\n\nThe Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of €2.2 billion to Portugal in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Portugal.\n\nThe Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.",

    "content": "YouTube today announced its decision to make the “dislike” count on videos private across its platform. The decision is likely to be controversial given the extent that it impacts the public’s visibility into a video’s reception. But YouTube believes the change will better protect its creators from harassment and reduce the threat of what it calls “dislike attacks” — essentially, when a group teams up to drive up the number of dislikes a video receives.\n\nThe company says that while dislike counts won’t be visible to the public, it’s not removing the dislike button itself. Users can still click the thumbs down button on videos to signal their dislike to creators privately. Meanwhile, creators will be able to track their dislikes in YouTube Studio alongside other analytics about their video’s performance, if they choose.\n\nThe change follows an experiment YouTube ran earlier this year whose goal was to determine if these sorts of changes would reduce dislike attacks and creator harassment.\n\nAt the time, YouTube explained that public dislike counts can affect creators’ well-being and may motivate targeted campaigns to add dislikes to videos. While that’s true, dislikes can also serve as a signal to others when videos are clickbait, spam or misleading, which can be useful.\n\nYouTube said it had also heard from smaller creators and others who were just getting started on the platform that they felt they were being unfairly targeted by dislike attacks. The experiment confirmed this was true — creators with smaller channels were targeted with dislike attacks more than larger creators were.\n\nYouTube declined to share the specific details or the data collected through those experiments when TechCrunch asked, however. But it said it ran its tests for “multiple months” and conducted “in-depth analysis of the impact” as to how the changes affected both users and creators alike.\n\nThe company had experimented with different designs for removing the dislike counts, including one where the word “Dislike” appeared underneath the thumbs down button instead of the number of dislikes. This is the design the company has now settled on, which is less of a disruptive change to the row of engagement buttons beneath a video.The company would not be the first major platform to experiment with the idea of reducing the public visibility of signals that convey user sentiment. For similar mental health-related reasons, Instagram a couple of years ago began tests to hide its Like counts globally. It believed the focus on achieving Likes could be detrimental to its community and may make creators less comfortable expressing themselves on the platform. Ultimately, though, neither Facebook nor Instagram could fully commit to a decision and instead put the power to hide Likes back under users’ control — a move that effectively kept the status quo intact.\n\nYouTube’s changes to the “dislike” count are being introduced at a time when there’s been a public reckoning over big tech and its impact on mental health, particularly when it comes to minors. Companies have been rethinking how their systems are designed to target and influence their user base, as well as what sort of changes they can make ahead of coming regulations. In a number of markets, lawmakers have been dragging in tech execs to hearings — YouTube included — and are crafting legislation aimed at reigning in some of tech’s more problematic elements. Mental health is only one area of regulatory interest, though, along with ad targeting, privacy, algorithmic boosting of misinformation and more.\n\nIn YouTube’s case, the company has attempted to get ahead of some of the required changes by implementing increased protections and privacy features for users ages 13 to 17 while also decreasing the monetization potential for “unhealthy” kids’ content. But the larger shift in the market is also pushing companies to consider the other areas of their platforms that are potentially toxic to broad groups of people.\n\nThat said, YouTube told TechCrunch today’s removal of the dislike count is not being guided by any regulatory changes, but rather its support for creators.\n\n“We are proactively making this change because YouTube has a responsibility to protect creators, especially smaller creators, from harassment and dislike attacks,” a spokesperson said.\n\nThe company, of course, is also rolling this out when the battle for creator talent is becoming hugely competitive among tech giants. Today’s social platforms are establishing funds to retain their top creators amid increased competition, particularly from the growing threat of TikTok. YouTube this year announced a $100 million creator fund to jumpstart its short-form video platform, for example. And, over the past year or so, it’s introduced several new features and policies aimed at improving the creator experience.\n\nThe changes to the dislike count will roll out globally across YouTube’s platform starting today, including all devices and the web.",

The action was taken following a complaint from local record labels who argued that the second largest torrent site on the Internet was causing \"irreparable damages\" to the music industry. KickassTorrents, however, appears undeterred by the intervention and is continuing business as usual under a new domain name.\n\nkickassWith millions of visitors every day KickassTorrents (KAT) is one of the top torrenting sites on the Internet, trailing only behind The Pirate Bay.\n\nThis status has put the site on the radar of the U.S. Government and a wide variety of entertainment industry groups around the world.\n\nYesterday the torrent site ran into trouble with its KAT.ph domain, and there were signs suggesting the domain was no longer in control of the original owners. Over the past few hours more details have emerged, and the Government of the Philippines has now confirmed that the domain name has been seized on copyright grounds.\n\nThe seizure is the result of a complaint filed by the Philippine Association of the Recording Industry and several individual music labels. The complaint stated that KickassTorrents was causing “irreparable damages” to the music industry, and a local court agreed to suspend the site’s domain.\n\n“The complaint alleges that the registrant of KAT.ph is violating intellectual property rights by making copyrighted music available for download to its users,” the dotPH registry informed TorrentFreak.\n\nEarly this week the Philippine Intellectual Property Office issued a temporary restraining Order directing the dotPH registry to suspend the KAT.ph domain for 72 hours. The order, signed by the IPO Bureau of Legal Affairs, will become final if the domain owners don’t appeal.\n\nAccording to dotPH, the company that maintains the database of PH domain names, the music industry first complained about KickassTorrents in 2011. However, the company said at the time that it would only take action following a court order.\n\n“dotPH was initially contacted by the complainants’ lawyers in December of 2011 with a demand to take down the domain, and dotPH agreed to cooperate if provided with an order from a court or appropriate authority,” TorrentFreak was informed.\n\n“dotPH received the restraining order earlier this week and subsequently suspended kat.ph in compliance with IPO’s directive,” the registry adds.\n\nWhile the case is presented as a local action aimed at preventing piracy of original Filipino music, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise if U.S. forces have also been applying pressure. In its latest Special 301 Report the U.S. Government listed the Philippines on its copyright “watch list,” demanding further action against so-called rogue sites.\n\n“The United States looks to the Philippines to take important steps to address piracy over the Internet, in particular with respect to notorious online markets,” the Office of the United States Trade Representative wrote in its report.\n\nTorrentFreak reached out to the KickassTorrents team for a comment on the domain seizure, but we have yet to hear back.\n\nWhether the seizure will have much of an effect has yet to be seen. After the domain name was taken away KickassTorrents quickly moved to a new one, and the site continues to operate under the new Kickass.to domain.",

On Thursday, the 42-year-old was one of about 200 people wearing face masks and standing 6 feet apart in the Clark County Government Center’s outdoor amphitheater for the ceremony.\n\n“That night I lost a part of me, and I come back looking for it,” Soto said, with tears in her eyes.\n\nSince October 2017, Soto has moved from California to Minneapolis and has started her dream job as a flight attendant. She said that she decided to “live life to the fullest” for those who died in the attack.\n\nA slideshow during the ceremony displayed the names and pictures of the 58 people killed that night. The pictures of two women who died within the past year of injuries they suffered in the mass shooting were included at the end with a message reading, “In Memoriam of 1 October Victims Lost in the Last Year.”At the end of the ceremony, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced that the two women, Kimberly Gervais of Mira Loma, California, and Samanta Arjune of Las Vegas, will be added to the official death toll, raising the number from 58 to 60.\n\nThe announcement came after the Review-Journal on Monday published an article that highlighted their deaths and reported the Metropolitan Police Department’s initial decision not to include them in the death total.“It isn’t like we’re trying to avoid the names,” Lombardo said in a brief interview after the ceremony. He later added that, “At this point, I think I’m comfortable in acknowledging that the other two individuals lost their lives as a result of 1 October.”\n\nThere were fewer people at the ceremony this year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced officials to limit the number of people who could attend. Gov. Steve Sisolak, who also addressed the crowd, said that when he raised the limit on public gatherings this week, Thursday’s event was one of his “biggest priorities.”Sisolak’s voice grew shaky as he recalled that night and offered his condolences to the family members of those who died.\n\n“We will never, never forget what happened that day, or the lives that were lost, and the lives that were changed,” he said.\n\nAlbert Rivera, the father of Jordyn Rivera, who was 21 when she was killed in the attack, said he was thankful to all the survivors who continue to come together on the anniversary and support each other.\n\n“We are all a statistic — we are all part of this unwanted fraternity we didn’t chose to be a part of,” he said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged Greg Zanis, an Illinois carpenter who built 58 crosses honoring those who died in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Zanis died in May of terminal bladder cancer, and Rivera said he will “be forever changed” by Zanis’ kindness.\n\nHe ended his remarks by calling for unity during what he said has been a time of divisiveness in the U.S. He urged people to remember how they came together on Oct. 2, 2017.\n\n“It’s said that it takes more effort to hate than to love. Let’s remember that,” he said. “Until we meet again — here, there or in the air — may we all smile like Jordyn.”",

    "content": "Pilot error probably caused the 2019 crash of a World War II-era bomber in Connecticut that killed seven people and wounded six others, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report released Tuesday. It cited inadequate maintenance as a contributing factor.\n\nThe four-engine, propeller-driven B-17G Flying Fortress bomber with 13 people aboard crashed at Bradley International Airport during a traveling vintage aircraft show on Oct. 2, 2019.\n\nThe pilot, Ernest “Mac” McCauley, reported a problem with one of the engines shortly after takeoff, and the plane crashed into a maintenance building and burst into flames during a landing attempt.\n\nThe NTSB said the flight data indicated that the landing gear was extended too early, adding drag that slowed the plane, and it was traveling too slow on its return to the airport.\n\n“The B-17 could likely have overflown the approach lights and landed on the runway had the pilot kept the landing gear retracted and accelerated to 120 mph until it was evident the airplane would reach the runway,” the NTSB said.\n\nMcCauley, 75, of Long Beach, California, was a veteran pilot who colleagues said had great skills flying the B-17G. He and co-pilot Michael Foster, 71, of Jacksonville, Florida, were killed in the crash, along with five of the 10 passengers. The plane's mechanic, Mitchell Melton, of Hawkins, Texas, was among the injured and was the only crew member to survive.\n\nThe NTSB said there was a power loss in two of the four engines during the flight, a problem it blamed on McCauley's “inadequate maintenance.\" McCauley also served as the maintenance director of the plane's owner, the Collings Foundation, based in Stow, Massachusetts.\nThe NTSB also said the Collings Foundation had an ineffective safety management system that failed to identify hazards, including the inadequate maintenance of the plane. Investigators said the ineffective safety system, as well as the Federal Aviation Administration's ineffective oversight of the system, also contributed to the accident.\n\nThe Collings Foundation said in a statement Tuesday that it is reviewing the NTSB's findings. It did not directly address the NTSB's findings.\n\n“We knew Ernest “Mac” McCauley to be the most experienced B-17 pilot in the world who was passionate about the care and condition of all aircraft,” the foundation said. “Responsible flight and maintenance operations have always been a top priority of the Collings Foundation, reflected by over thirty years’ worth of a safe operating record, and always will be.”\n\nMelton told investigators that the No. 4 engine began losing power after takeoff and McCauley said he wanted to shut it off. Melton replied he wasn't ready to do that and didn't understand why the engine had to be shut off, but McCauley turned it off anyway, according to NTSB documents.\n\nMelton, of Hawkins, Texas, also said there were problems trying to start the Nos. 3 and 4 engines on the morning of the crash. But both started after he blew nitrogen into them to get rid of condensation than can build up on humid mornings — a procedure that representatives of the plane’s owner said is frequently used by airplane mechanics, but one an NTSB official said is “not a documented maintenance procedure,” according to NTSB documents.\n\nThe other two engines started without a problem, Melton told investigators.\n\nDuring the landing attempt, the plane struck the approach lights and contacted the ground before the runway before veering into the maintenance building, the NTSB said.\n\nThe passengers killed in the crash included Gary Mazzone, of East Windsor, Connecticut; Robert Riddell, of East Granby, Connecticut, James Roberts, of Ludlow, Massachusetts; David Broderick, of West Springfield, Massachusetts; and Robert Rubner, of Tolland, Connecticut.\n\nTen passengers had paid $450 to fly aboard the aircraft. The plane was one of several vintage aircraft at a show run by the Collings Foundation.\n\nAfter the crash, the foundation suspended its flights and tour for the rest of the year. In March 2020, the Federal Aviation Administration revoked the Collings Foundation’s permission to carry passengers aboard its World War II-era planes because of safety concerns stemming from the Bradley accident.\n\nThe foundation also is being sued in Connecticut state court by relatives of those killed and survivors. Lawyers for the foundation have denied wrongdoing in court documents.",

    "content": "A Twitter newly dedicated to curbing harassment on its platform is finding that its every action can result in a firestorm. Nearly a week after a little-known conservative writer was booted, the wider world of alt-right Twitter is now boiling in turmoil over his ouster. At least one high-profile tweeter, Adam Baldwin, has quit the platform in protest over the company's speech policies.\n\n \nAdam Baldwin\n@AdamBaldwin\nIn short, I will no longer voluntarily participate in a social media platform that fancies itself some sort of global online Oberlin campus.\n\n04:44 AM - 24 Feb 2016\nReply Retweet Favorite\nADVERTISEMENT\nInterested in Tech articles?\n\nThe issue erupted when Robert Stacy McCain, a self-described anti-feminist writer, was suspended last Friday for “participating in targeted abuse,” according to a Twitter email he posted on his blog, which also said his account will not be restored. (Twitter would not comment on the email's validity.) It remains unclear what, exactly, he tweeted that led to the ban.Some conservatives now argue that McCain is just the most recent victim of a new push by Twitter to police speech that unduly targets those on the right, and contradicts its long-standing commitment to free-speech. By centrally determining who can post and who can’t, they argue, Twitter is now acting as a sort of media censor.\n\nAnd while it’s important to note that Twitter has banned people of all political persuasions, and that the crackdown does not seem agenda-driven, McCain is far from the only conservative to be affected. In January, for example, Twitter removed right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’s verification badge due to unspecified rules violations. All of which is giving some of its more outspoken users pause.\n\n“In trying to lure new users with promises of ‘safety,’ [Twitter] risks destroying the sense of free-wheeling openness that attracted many of its existing users,” Robert Tracinski, a senior writer at The Federalist, wrote in response to McCain’s suspension.\n\nHarassment is a complicated problem for Twitter and the people who use it. While it has tools for muting and blocking other people, vicious tweets can come in so fast and from so many angles that those tools are often ineffective. Also, problems can spill out from Twitter into the wider internet, and even into people’s very homes. It’s not uncommon for one person to post a target’s personal information to Twitter, for example, that ultimately results in a swatting attempt by someone else.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nTwitter has been pushed to do more to curb this type of harassment on its platform for years, and has experienced some embarrassing public failures when it’s been unable or unwilling to do so. Zelda Williams, for example, quit the platform for a time after being harassed following the death of her father, Robin, in 2014.\n\nComplicating matters, Twitter has long declared itself “the free speech wing of the free speech party,” so any effort to remove people or tweets inherently contradicts that stance, and unsurprisingly sparks protests from its users. The seemingly contradictory goals of openness and safety put Twitter in a difficult position. When a political voice like McCain’s says things that Twitter says violate its terms of service, the company has to make a difficult choice: Does it come down on the side of supporting free speech, or combatting abuse? In this case, the company chose the latter.\n\nTwitter’s actions in this effort have serious implications, since much of the political discussion that once took place on the open web now takes place within the walls of social platforms. Losing your seat there is like getting kicked out of the town squares of old, you’ll have to work much harder from the outside to be heard.\n\n“Our abusive behavior policy prohibits targeted harassment and violent threats, and we will suspend accounts violating that rule when they are reported to us,” a Twitter spokesperson said in response to a BuzzFeed News inquiry.\n\nEarlier this month, when it unveiled a new Trust and Safety Council, Twitter made the case that finding the balance between speech and safety isn’t easy: “The volume of content on Twitter is massive, which makes it extraordinarily complex to strike the right balance between fighting abuse and speaking truth to power.”\n\nNo kidding.\n\nReached via phone Tuesday night, McCain said he’s not concerned the Twitter ban will silence his voice. “The thing is that I’m an innovative person and I’m a survivor,” he said. ”I’m a winner. I’ve been winning my whole life. The idea that my personal voice will never be heard again on Twitter. Ha! We’ll see.”\n\nStill, he admitted he missed Twitter. “It was fun,“ he said. “But they don’t want me anymore. It’s kind of weird. This is a weird experience to be a hashtag.”",

    "content": "VATICAN CITY (CNS) — The “unprecedented” environmental and social crisis in the Amazon calls for “a deep personal, social and structural conversion” that leads to new ways of caring for “our common home,” according to the Synod of Bishops for the Amazon.\n\nIn seeking new forms of development that are just and promote solidarity, the church must learn from the region’s original peoples “in a dialogue of wisdom,” synod members said in their final document, released Oct. 26.\n\n“God has given us the earth as a gift and as a task, to care for it and to answer for it; we do not own it,” the synod members wrote.\n\nCaring for the earth requires an integral ecology that connects “the exercise of care for nature with the exercise of justice for the most impoverished and disadvantaged on earth,” they wrote.\n\nIntegral ecology, they said, is not just one path open, “it is the only path, because there is no other viable route for saving the region.”\n\nThe economies of the nine Amazonian countries still depend heavily on revenues from raw materials like oil, metals and timber, as well as industrial farming and ranching.\n\nSuch activities “uproot the lives of peoples and the common goods of the earth, concentrating economic and political power in the hands of a few,” often with the support or permission of local, national and foreign governments, the document said.\n\nAlthough it may not be possible to change that model of development in the short run, the church must decide where it stands, and what implications faith has for politics and ethics, the synod members said.\n\nDenouncing the destruction and human rights violations related to extractive industries, synod member also affirmed their support for campaigns that call for institutions, including the church, to give up investments in extractive companies that cause environmental damage or social harm.\n\nThey also called for energy policies that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, and promote clean energy alternatives that contribute to better health.\n\n“The future of the Amazon is in the hands of us all, but it depends mainly on our immediately abandoning the current model that is destroying the forest, not bringing well-being and endangering this immense natural treasure and its guardians,” they wrote.\n\nThose guardians are the Amazonian communities, especially indigenous peoples, who protect the forests and rivers of the Amazon.\n\n“They have clearly stated that they want the church to accompany them, to walk with them, and not to impose on them a particular way of being, a specific form of development that has little to do with their cultures, traditions and spiritualties,” the synod members wrote.\n\n“They know how to take care of the Amazon, how to love and protect it,” they added. “What they need is for the church to support them.”\n\nIndigenous people who were observers at the synod asked the church to back them in their demand for legal recognition of their territories, to protect against incursions by illegal loggers and miners or the concession of their lands to development projects or extractive industries. The synod document specifically mentioned the importance of defending territories inhabited by semi-nomadic people who shun contact with outsiders.\n\nPeople who publicly defend their territorial rights are often criminally prosecuted, harassed or targeted for assassination, indigenous synod participants said. In the document, the synod members said the church must support them against persecution.\n\nThe church also must help Amazonian peoples preserve and maintain their traditional “knowledge, innovations and practices,” the synod participants said, and must support their right to decide about plans and proposals for sustainable development in their territories.\n\nIn the process of “deep personal, social and structural conversion” in defense of the Amazon, the church and others must “unlearn, learn and relearn” in order to avoid repeating “colonializing models that have caused harm in the past,” the synod members said.\n\nSuch a conversion requires recognition of “ecological sins of commission or omission against God, against one’s neighbor, the community and the environment,” which are also “sins against future generations,” they wrote. Those sins include pollution, environmental destruction, and transgressions against interdependence and justice.\n\nThe synod called for parishes and dioceses to create ministries of “care for our common home,” to promote integral ecology, raise awareness of the teachings in Pope Francis’ encyclical “Laudato Si’,” and engage in education and advocacy.\n\nSynod members also called for individuals to make lifestyle changes to reduce consumption, such as using less plastic, eating less meat and reducing dependence on fossil fuels and plastics.\n\nAs a follow-up to the synod, the members proposed creation of a pastoral office that would work with church institutions, other organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples to track socio-environmental conflicts and help the church “take a position, make decisions and defend the rights of the most vulnerable.”\n\n“The church has been and is at the side of the indigenous communities,” they wrote, “to safeguard the right to have their own tranquil life, respecting the values of their traditions, customs and cultures, the preservation of rivers and forests which are sacred spaces, sources of life and wisdom.”",

    "content": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic will plunge Germany’s economy into its deepest recession since World War Two, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday as the government cut its economic growth forecast for this year.“We’re facing major challenges, both economically and politically,” Altmaier told reporters in Berlin, presenting the government’s updated growth forecast for Europe’s largest economy.\n\nBerlin cut its estimate for gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2020 to -6.3% from +1.1% predicted in January. It expects the recession to bottom out in the second quarter and economic activity to pick up again after that, provided a second wave of infections can be avoided.\n\nFor 2021, the government expects the economy to rebound with an expansion rate of +5.2%. The forecasts are based on the assumption that authorities can gradually unwind lockdown measures imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAltmaier said Germany should not rush to ease the lockdown measures as this would increase the risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections, which could hamper the expected economic recovery in the second half of the year.\n\n“Because only if we lift economic and social restrictions step-by-step, and with a sense of proportion, can we start with the slow recovery in the second half of year,” Altmaier said.\n\nEurope’s most populous country has 157,641 confirmed coronavirus cases and 6,115 deaths, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.\n\nThe government expects consumer price inflation to drop to 0.5% in 2020 and rebound to 1.5% in 2021.\n\nUnemployment is seen rising to 2.62 million in 2020 from an average 2.27 million in 2019, with the number of people working reduced or zero hours under the government’s expanded Kurzarbeit short-time work schemes expected to soar to 3 million.\n\nFURTHER MEASURES\nAltmaier said the government was considering further measures to help sectors that have been hit particularly hard, such as restaurants, catering and the trade fair industry.\n\nThe minister also underlined Berlin’s plans for a post-crisis stimulus package to support the economic recovery, adding that the government wanted to support private consumption.\n\nProposals discussed by senior members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition for the stimulus package include a higher cash incentive for buying electric cars.\n\nThe VDA car lobby group wants any cash incentives to also include vehicles with combustion engines. But Merkel has made clear that she wants to combine the task of helping companies recover from the pandemic with the challenge of reducing carbon emissions.\n\nGermany has already approved an initial rescue package worth over 750 billion euros to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, with the government this year taking on new debt for the first time since 2013.\n\nThe first package agreed in March comprises a debt-financed supplementary budget of 156 billion euros and a stabilisation fund worth 600 billion euros for loans to struggling businesses and direct stakes in companies.",

    "content": "ROME — This time, Southern Europe isn’t taking nein for an answer.\n\nAs coronavirus cuts a swath of economic destruction across Europe, pushing the already-strained budgets of southern countries to the brink, calls are getting louder for the eurozone to intervene by issuing debt backed by all members.\n\nThe EU “must act before it’s too late,” Italian President Sergio Mattarella, a man not known for drifting into pathos, warned in a televised address to the nation on Friday.The logic behind the so-called corona bonds is simple: If high-debt countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy could borrow money with Germany’s backing as a guarantor, investors would consider them less of a credit risk and demand lower interest rates, making it easier for those countries to continue to tap the bond market.\n\n“We aren’t asking for a mutualization of debt, but the mutualization of the excessive risk of recession,” Italy’s EU Minister Enzo Amendola told a group of journalists. “I cannot help but flag the risks of a lack of unity.”For Germany and its northern allies, the idea is a nonstarter. Even as they’ve put in place massive rescue packages for their own populations, they’ve shown little willingness to help their southern neighbors. Though Italy insists it can pay back whatever it borrows and is only asking its eurozone partners to effectively co-sign its loans, not to foot the bill, many economists doubt it would be able to do so.\n\nGermans fear they would be left holding the bag. While pooling debt might make economic sense for the eurozone as a whole, in Germany — where former Chancellor Helmut Kohl only managed to sell the common currency in the 1990s by promising Germans they wouldn’t end up paying other countries’ debts (“The community carries no liability for the obligations of its members”) — violating the euro’s founding principle would count as a historic betrayal.\n\nDuring the eurozone debt crisis that began in 2010, it was concern that Chancellor Angela Merkel was backtracking on Kohl’s promises that fueled the rise of the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), now the country’s largest opposition force. Then, as now, countries on Europe’s periphery quickly demanded “solidarity” from their northern neighbors in the form of common debt issuance — and Germany and its allies quickly responded with a firm “no.”\n\nDuring the euro crisis, it was fairly easy for Berlin to dismiss the calls for eurobonds by pointing out that the likes of Greece and Spain had only themselves to blame for the troubles they faced. Merkel took little offense at being cast as the crotchety schoolmarm chiding Southern Europeans for not “doing their homework.”\n\nThis time is different. No one in Europe did their homework; the risks posed by the pandemic were underestimated by all. As a result, people are dying in large numbers and economic activity has ground to a halt.\n\n‘Writing history’\nWhile there’s no way to gauge the emotional toll the crisis is taking on hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain, there’s no doubt that it is substantial. Just as the trauma of the pandemic will be etched into Southern Europe’s collective conscious for generations to come, so too will the reaction of their northern cousins.\n\n“Do you not understand the emergency we are going through?” an exasperated Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez asked Merkel during last week’s EU summit.\n\nThe German leader insisted she did. Even so, corona bonds remained off the table.\n\nJust as during the euro crisis, Germany’s idea of solidarity during the epidemic more resembles tough love than a warm embrace.\n\nInstead of common debt issuance, Berlin is pushing for bailout loans with strict conditionality. Its preference would be for countries that need help to apply for loans from the European Stability Mechanism, the currency bloc’s €500 billion bailout fund.\n\nBut the conditions on that aid are onerous. Countries are placed under the supervision of the so-called Troika — the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund — and forced to implement difficult economic reforms.\n\nItalian leaders argue that the pandemic was beyond their control and that Rome shouldn’t be compelled to accept such strictures. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, speaking on German public television on Tuesday, cautioned Germans not to overlook the historic dimension of what is unfolding across the Continent.\n\n“We are not writing the page of an economic manual, we are writing the page of a history book,” Conte said. “Europe needs to demonstrate whether it is the common house for European citizens, whether — faced with epochal challenge — it succeeds in offering an adequate response that lives up to the tasks it was created for by [EU founding fathers] Schuman, Adenauer, De Gasperi.”\n\nThe prime-time interview followed an open letter from a group of Italian mayors and senior politicians that was published in Tuesday’s edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the daily bulletin of Germany’s conservative establishment, demanding that Germany accept debt mutualization.\n\nThe signatories recalled that Italy, Spain and other countries forgave much of the debt that Germany owed after World War II. “Dear German friends, remembrance helps one make the right decisions,” they wrote.\n\nFor now, the Germans, backed by the Dutch, Austrian and Finns, are holding firm.\n\nIn the south, the northern alliance has brought lingering resentment over the way Mediterranean countries were treated during the euro crisis back to the surface.\n\nA suggestion by Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra last week that the European Commission prepare a report on why some countries lacked the fiscal space to weather the current crisis triggered a firestorm.\n\n“This recurrent pettiness completely undermines what the spirit of the European Union is,” Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa said, calling the suggestion “repugnant.”\n\nTo many southern ears, the Dutchman’s comment recalled a remark in 2017 by the country’s then-Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem that the region couldn’t “spend all the money on drinks and women and then ask for help.”\n\nSo far, German officials have avoided such missteps, and many are uncomfortable with the perception that they are working in concert with the Dutch.\n\nItalian connection\nIf Southern Europe is going to win Berlin’s support for more generous assistance, it will need to convince Germans that their own prosperity is at stake.\n\nWhile German public opinion and Merkel’s Christian Democrats are solidly opposed to pooling debt, the Social Democrats, the chancellor’s junior coalition partner, are open to the idea, as are the Greens.\n\nIf nothing else, that support could trigger a genuine debate in Germany. Over the years, the country’s discussion about how and whether to support other eurozone countries has taken place in cartoonish terms: In the popular imagination, Germany is the disciplined, hard-working northerner and everyone needing help is the polar opposite.\n\nThat Germany has been the greatest beneficiary of both the euro and European integration is something many in the country don’t understand, largely because their politicians aren’t making that case.\n\nThe fact that many Germans feel a deep connection to Italy may also help. In contrast to its relationship with most of its neighbors, Germany’s ties to Italy are not as burdened by a deep sense of historic guilt. During Germany’s postwar boom, hundreds of thousands of Italians came as “guest workers,” and many stayed. The number of German visitors to Italy every year (12 million) is double that of any other country.\n\nIn short, the cultural and personal ties between the two countries are substantial. If there’s one country Germany are going to help out of a crisis, it’s Italy.\n\nAnd yet, stereotypes about Italy’s free spending ways persist in Germany, even though Rome’s fiscal challenges are rooted in Italy’s tepid economic growth and not a lack of budgetary discipline.\n\nWhether Southern Europe ends up securing corona bonds (which remains unlikely given Northern Europe’s stiff resistance) or some other form of assistance, it won’t come cheap.\n\nThe shutdown will cost Italy billions of euros per month. So far, the government has sought to borrow an extra €25 billion and announced it wants to borrow €25 billion more. With Italy’s total debt already at €2.5 trillion, or about 130 percent of its GDP, it doesn’t have much room to maneuver. (By comparison, Germany’s debt to GDP ratio, a key marker of a country’s creditworthiness, is just above 60 percent.)\n\n“It’s safe to say Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to around 180 percent by the end of this year,” said Alberto Bisin, a professor of economics at New York University.\n\nItaly, he added, will struggle to pay that back. “It’s either you raise taxes, which is unfeasible in Italy since they are already extremely high, or you repay it through sustained economic growth which needs structural reforms to happen and these haven’t been passed in 30 years.”\n\n“So either northern countries decide they will face the costs to avoid Italy crashing out of the eurozone, or I don’t see many alternatives,” he added. “We’re pigeonholed.”\n\nSpain, Portugal and Greece are almost certain to face similar challenges.\n\nThis week, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, after angering Italian leaders by dismissing corona bonds out of hand, suggested the EU budget could be used to offer support. But given the amount of aid countries need, the question is whether it would be enough.\n\nInstead of focusing on the details of how to extend aid, leaders across Southern Europe have implored their northern partners to recognize that what’s at stake is the future of the EU itself.\n\n“Either the EU does what it has to do or it will end,” Portugal’s Costa said.",

Mike Rail, a spokesperson for Chilliwack RCMP. “At the conclusion of a thorough investigation, Chilliwack RCMP, in consultation with the BC Prosecution Service, will determine the next course of action.”\n\nSeveral dozen people were at the 11 a.m. service at Free Grace Baptist.\n\n“For myself, I believe in worshipping God with the fellowship of my brothers and sisters in Christ,” said Brendan Vugteveen, who is not a member of the church but went because he knew it was open. “I think that’s extremely important, not just for obedience to God, but for my own spiritual health as well.”\n\nThere was no visible RCMP presence at the church Sunday.\n\n“If they feel inclined to enact anything against myself, personally, I am open to discussion with them,” said Vugteveen. “If they’d like to speak to me, they can.”\n\nBoth Free Grace Baptist and Riverside Calvary Chapel also stream their services online.",

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made the appeal in an address to an online climate conference hosted by Japan.\n\nGuterres noted that many countries are using the opportunity of the pandemic to double down on green energy and other initiatives, aiming to attain a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average.\n\n“We are facing two critical crises, COVID and climate change,” he said in pre-recorded remarks. He said he hoped the meeting would “leave future generations with the hope that this moment is the true turning point for people and the planet.”\n\nA major U.N. Climate Change Conference due to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, this November was postponed due to the pandemic. Dubbed COP26, it is to be held there in early November 2021.\n\nJapan’s Environment Ministry has led an initiative called the Online Platform for Sustainable and Resilient Recovery from COVID-19, or “Platform for Redesign 2020.” Its website says it is a hub that collates countries’ climate and other environmental policies and actions that are planned and implemented in the context of recovery from COVID-19.\n\nGuterres noted that Japan’s advanced technology in many fields should make it a leader in shifting to renewable energy and urged it to stop financing construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe top priorities, he said, are prioritizing “green” jobs, ending subsidies for use of fossil fuels and taking energy and climate change issues into account in all decisions.\n\n“Clean energy delivers more jobs, cleaner air, better health and stronger economic growth,” Guterres said.\n\n“It makes no sense economically to burn money on coal plants that will soon become stranded assets,” he added. “There is simply no rational case for coal power in any investment plan.”\n\nJapan scaled back its ambitions for shifting to renewable energy after the massive March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown disasters in the northeastern Tohoku region led it to close down its nuclear power plants for safety overhauls.\n\nSome have restarted but most have not. In the meantime, the country has made up for lost power generating capacity by boosting use of coal, oil and gas, ramping up use of solar power and reducing waste.\n\nThe government also has sought to export its expertise and technology by helping to finance construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\nGuterres said the goals of halving global emissions by 2030 and achieving “carbon neutrality” by 2050 — key to limiting global warming — were achievable, “but we are currently off track.”He urged countries participating in the conference to come up with more ambitious plans and long-term strategies before COP26 next year.\n\nIn comments delivered on the website Platform for Redesign 2020, Japan’s environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, said the endeavor aims to help countries “redesign their economic and social systems in this time of dual crises.”\n\nThe pandemic has slowed most activities, he noted, but “climate change gives us no time to waste.”\n\n“Our task is not to return to the pre-pandemic world, but to build back better,” he said.",

    "content": "BEIRUT — Lebanon declared an economic emergency Sept. 2 following a downgrade from two of the three major credit rating agencies and slowed GDP growth — 0% according to the credit rating agency Fitch.\n\nThese precarious economic conditions have raised concern over the country's ability to maintain one of its most successful monetary policies: the fixed exchange rate between the Lebanese pound and US dollar.\n\nIn 1980, the exchange rate was around 3 Lebanese pounds to 1 dollar. In just over a decade, this increased to over 2,500 pounds to 1 dollar. This rapid change in the exchange rate deterred investors.\n\nThis economic instability was in large part due to the Lebanese Civil War, which began in 1975. But by the mid-1990s, the conflict was de-escalating and reconstruction was a priority. However, the government struggled to attract investors due to currency inflation. One answer to this was a currency peg, fixing 1,507.5 pounds to 1 dollar by 1997. \n\nSimon Neaime, professor of economics and finance at the American University of Beirut, explained to Al-Monitor, “It was done to signal that your investments that come in will have the same purchasing power or the same value when you get it out.” He added that it also gave local banks the confidence to loan the government the capital it needed for reconstruction.\n\nThe burden of keeping the Lebanese pound and the dollar equal fell on Lebanon’s central bank, Banque du Liban, which used its foreign currency reserves to defend the peg.\n\nThis largely manifested through Banque du Liban buying government debt and instituting high interest rates designed to incentivize people to deposit their money in the country. \n\nA side effect of this was that local banks could make money through favorable interest rates and buying up government debt as opposed to investing in productive industries.\n\nToby Iles, director of Middle East Africa Sovereigns for Fitch, told Al-Monitor, “The negative [here] is partly that banks can make [a] profit by buying government debt, while the healthier thing would be for banks to lend to the economy which goes into productive sectors, which would mean the economy is less out of balance.”\n\nHowever, as long as money flowed into Lebanon, Banque du Liban’s reserves were high, government debt was bought and the peg was stable, but, as Neaime noted, “The story lately has changed.” \n\nCurrently, the reserves — excluding gold and other assets — are declining, with some predicting that without reforms, the reserves can only cover another year.\n\nAccording to Fitch, the reserves have dropped nearly $3 billion since the end of 2018, leaving $29.1 billion in June 2019, and will decline $3 billion each year in 2020 and 2021.\n\nIles explained, “How high do reserves need to be to maintain confidence? There are a number of indicators to analyze, but it is kind of an unanswerable question.” \n\nHe added, “The thing that concerns us most recently is that you have had this pressure on bank deposits and reserves and yet there hasn't been a singular big crisis or event.”\n\nPreviously, when Lebanon went through an economic crisis, there was a singular event that shook confidence — be it the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005 or the 2006 Israeli war.\n\nCurrently, the situation is a death from a thousand cuts: the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri in 2017; the stalled government formation last year, which lasted nine months; delay in the 2019 budget; sanctions on Hezbollah; escalation with Israel; and the conflict in neighboring Syria.\n\nThe accumulation of these issues has led to a lack of confidence in Lebanon’s stability and seen foreign investments and remittances drop off. In a country that imports more than it exports, these capital inflows were a major avenue for Lebanon to equalize its balance of payments and keep its reserves high.\n\nLebanese inside the country have also been shaken by poor economic conditions, reducing their deposits in local banks and converting them into dollars, which is seen as more stable, resulting in a rise in dollarization.\n\nTo solve this, interest rates — particularly on government debts — rise to keep money in the country by providing better returns. However, this has contributed to government debt — the majority of which is held by the central and local banks — as an expense taking up 47% of state revenues, according to Fitch.\n\nBut this is a catch-22, with the government spending and Banque du Liban dipping into their reserves to ensure money stays in the country, while a major reason why money is leaving the country is because Lebanon is spending too much and reserves are declining.\n\nNeaime said, “The high interest the government is paying is affecting the deficit because it is government expenditure and it is increasing the debt.”\n\nBanque du Liban has engaged in financial engineering previously to keep the exchange rate fixed and could do something similar again. However, Neaime said, “I think they have used most of their tricks, I don't think they have much left.”\n\nHowever, Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOMINVEST, the investment arm of one of Lebanon’s largest banks, told Al-Monitor that this “vicious cycle” could, with the right measures, be turned into a “virtuous cycle.” \n\nPart of this requires the government to reduce the gap between their spending and revenues through reforms — which Mikhael said was occurring behind the scenes for the state-owned electricity provider, Electricite du Liban, which costs the state up to $2 billion a year.\n\nHowever, Lebanon will also need to secure capital inflows, which could be delivered in the short to medium term through the $11 billion worth of soft loans offered at the CEDRE Conference, and even the prospects of oil and gas. Then confidence would recover, and the situation could improve. \n\nHowever, Neaime said it is a “race against time,” even though very few in Lebanon want the peg to go.\n\nIles said, “I don’t think Lebanon would want to pursue a policy of changing [the peg], the central bank would really want to hang on to it. There are good reasons for that; in the near term, coming off the peg won’t have any immediate positives, but it would have a lot of negatives.”\n\nHe added that they would include “an effect on GDP per capita, living standards, government debt would be higher, the banking sector would face issues across their balance sheet and there would probably be a big recession.”\n\n\n\nRead more: https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2019/09/lebanon-fixed-currency-exchange-rate-economic-stability.html#ixzz7Mu37oF7K",

The disciples ask Him, “Teacher, do you not care if we perish?”\n\nThe Pope said these words would have shaken Jesus, “because He, more than anyone, cares about us.”\n\nThe storm, said the Pope, exposes “our vulnerability and uncovers those false and superfluous certainties around which we have constructed our daily schedules” and lays bare “all those attempts to anesthetize ourselves”.\n\nWhat is revealed, he said, is “our belonging as brothers and sisters”, our common humanity.\n\n“Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?\nPope Francis then picked up the thread of Jesus’ question: “Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?”\n\nHe said we have all gone ahead “at breakneck speed”, ignoring the wars, injustice, and cries of the poor and our ailing planet. “We carried on regardless, thinking we would stay healthy in a world that was sick.”\n\nIn our stormy sea, we now cry out: “Wake up, Lord!”Now is the time of choosing\nReally, said Pope Francis, it is Jesus calling out to us to be converted, calling us to faith.\n\n“You are calling on us to seize this time of trial as a time of choosing,” he said.\n\nNow is not the time of God’s judgment, but of our own: “a time to choose what matters and what passes away, a time to separate what is necessary from what is not.”\n\nThe Pope said we can draw lessons from the many people who – even though fearful – have reacted by giving their lives, including medical personnel, supermarket clerks, cleaners, priests, police officers, and volunteers. This, he said, “is the force of the Spirit poured out and fashioned in courageous and generous self-denial.”\n\nStripped of our self-sufficiency\nPope Francis said faith begins “when we realize we are in need of salvation” and are not self-sufficient.\n\nIf we turn to Jesus and hand Him our fears, said the Pope, He will conquer them.\n\n“Because this is God’s strength: turning to the good everything that happens to us, even the bad things. He brings serenity into our storms, because with God life never dies.”\n\nSo God asks us now, in the midst of the tempest, “to reawaken and put into practice that solidarity and hope capable of giving strength, support and meaning to these hours when everything seems to be floundering.”\n\nHis cross is our hope\nJesus’ cross, said Pope Francis, is the anchor that has saved us, the rudder that has redeemed us, and our hope, because “by His cross we have been healed and embraced so that nothing and no one can separate us from His redeeming love.”\n\n“In the midst of isolation when we are suffering from a lack of tenderness and chances to meet up, and we experience the loss of so many things,” he said, “let us once again listen to the proclamation that saves us: He is risen and is living by our side.”\n\nSo we embrace His cross in the hardships of the present time, and make room in our hearts “for the creativity that only the Spirit is capable of inspiring.”\n\n“Embracing the Lord in order to embrace hope: that is the strength of faith, which frees us from fear and gives us hope.”\n\nTurning to the Lord\nConcluding his meditation, Pope Francis entrusted us all to the Lord, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, so that our faith might not waiver in this time of crisis.\n\n“Dear brothers and sisters, from this place that tells of Peter’s rock-solid faith, I would like this evening to entrust all of you to the Lord, through the intercession of Mary, Health of the People and Star of the stormy Sea. From this colonnade that embraces Rome and the whole world, may God’s blessing come down upon you as a consoling embrace. Lord, may you bless the world, give health to our bodies and comfort our hearts. You ask us not to be afraid. Yet our faith is weak and we are fearful. But you, Lord, will not leave us at the mercy of the storm. Tell us again: ‘Do not be afraid’ (Mt 28:5). And we, together with Peter, ‘cast all our anxieties onto you, for you care about us’ (cf. 1Pet 5:7).”",

    "content": "TORONTO (Reuters) - A key supplier of the chemicals needed to test for coronavirus, France's Biomérieux BIOX.PA, has given its proprietary formula to the Canadian government for free so its national lab can try to manufacture badly-needed test kits on its own, according to federal officials and a note to customers obtained by Reuters.The unusual deal shows Ottawa’s determination to scale up testing, a key step towards relaxing strict public health measures that have disrupted daily life and tanked economies around the world.\n\nIn March, Canada passed emergency legislation that gave the government and third parties it designates the right to produce patented goods without the patent holders’ consent. Doing that could have been technically difficult, without a company’s formula.\n\nWhile there is no indication that Canada forced Biomerieux to agree to the license, the option was available.\n\nBiomérieux did not respond to questions about whether it had made similar arrangements with any other governments, or the revenue impact of the agreement.\n\nIt reported a 21.5% increase in sales in the first quarter, thanks in part to demand for reagent.The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) described the arrangement as a temporary license that allows the government to manufacture Biomérieux products used for coronavirus testing. It did not say whether it threatened to use the new law, and said the license was signed “at no cost.”\n\nPHAC said its manufacturing was still in “development and testing” and its goal was to alleviate shortages soon.\n\nIn its email to customers in early April, Biomérieux’s Canadian unit said the move was meant to clear up testing backlogs, an indication of the stress in the supply chain that makes testing possible. The company said it was also boosting its own production.\n\nThe chemicals in short supply, also called reagents, are used to extract RNA, the virus’s genetic material, from patient samples. A handful of companies make most RNA extraction equipment and sell reagent kits made for their own machines, a bit like inkjet printer cartridges.\n\nOther major suppliers are Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.N acquisition target Qiagen and Roche ROG.S. All are facing soaring demand, as public health workers around the world race to find people who could be spreading the virus.“We hope that in the near future, this move will allow federal and provincial labs to test more Canadians, thus reducing testing backlogs,” Biomerieux said in its customer note.\n\n“This private-public collaboration signals that unprecedented times, require unprecedented solutions.” Biomérieux extraction equipment is widely used in Canada.\n\nIts machines were the primary system used by Ontario’s public health labs, and heavy reliance on one brand contributed to a testing slowdown in late March. Biomérieux equipment is also widely used in Quebec, according to the provincial government.\n\nPHAC said the deal is an “interim solution”, because its facilities are not meant to be used for long-term manufacturing.\n\nOn Thursday, Canada pledged C$1.1 billion ($782 million) for research and drug or vaccine manufacturing in its fight against the coronavirus.",

The Tianhe space station core module separated from the first stage after 490 seconds of flight.\n\nSolar array deployment occurred just over an hour after launch. Li Shangfu, chief commander of the China Manned Spaceflight Program, announced launch success shortly after.Tianhe, or “harmony of the heavens,” is now expected to raise its orbit to around 370 kilometers above the Earth. The uncrewed Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft is slated to rendezvous and dock with Tianhe in mid-late May, ahead of the visit of three astronauts aboard Shenzhou-12 in June. \n\nThe missions will be the first three of 11 launches scheduled for 2021 and 2022 to build the planned 66-ton, three-module orbital outpost. A Long March 2F rocket and Shenzhou spacecraft will also be on standby at all times at Jiuquan to perform emergency rescue missions to the space station, a senior space official stated in March.\n\nTianhe, a much larger upgrade on China’s smaller, 8-ton Tiangong testbed space labs, is equipped with a multi-docking hub to facilitate construction of the space station and allow crew to embark on extravehicular activities.\n\nThe 16.6-meter-long, 4.2-meter-diameter Tianhe will provide regenerative life support and the main living quarters for astronauts as well as propulsion to maintain orbital altitude. \n\nThe construction phase of China’s space station begins nearly 30 years after the project was first approved, back in 1992.\n\nAcross this period China has developed and tested the Shenzhou spacecraft and Long March 2F for human spaceflight, Tianlian relay satellites, rendezvous and docking technologies, refueling in microgravity, new launch vehicles and the coastal Wenchang Satellite Launch Center in order to proceed with the project. \n\nThe CSS is expected to operate in orbit for at least ten years. Experiment modules named Wentian and Mengtian, expected to launch in 2022, will host a plethora of experiments in areas including astronomy, space medicine, space life science, biotechnology, microgravity fluid physics, microgravity combustion and space technologies. \n\nInternational science payloads and experiments have also been selected for a journey to the CSS through cooperation between the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) \n\nChina had expressed interest in joining the International Space Station project but membership was effectively denied by U.S. policy towards China’s space programs.\n\nThe launch of the Tianhe core module was delayed by the 2017 launch failure of the second Long March 5. The saw the postponement of the test launch of the Long March 5B variant for low Earth orbit launches while issues with the YF-77 liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen engine for the core stage were isolated and remedied.\n\nThe CSS will also be joined in orbit by the Xuntian optical module, a co-orbiting, Hubble-class space telescope. The space telescope will have a 2-meter-aperture comparable to Hubble but feature a field of view 300 times greater, allowing 40 percent of the sky to be surveyed across a decade.\n\nXuntian will be capable of docking with the CSS for maintenance and repairs. The space station itself could also be expanded from three to six modules, using modules developed as backups.",

Closing them is out of the question, officials said.\n\n“Suppose if we closed the border — these people would have come in big numbers (with the help of) human traffickers via illegal routes that would have caused far more positive cases, danger and deaths in Afghanistan,” Waheed Mayar, a Public Health Ministry spokesman, told Arab News.\n\nThe main official crossing point leads to the Herat province in western Afghanistan, which has become the area worst affected by COVID-19.\n\nJavid said authorities, for their part, had increased preventive measures which include checking all returnees and isolating those affected by the virus.\n\n“We have increased precautionary measures along the border with Iran to fight the spread of COVID-19, but the main challenge is the illegal crossings. We are assessing the situation closely and will make new decisions as things evolve in the coming days and weeks,” he told Arab News.\n\nAs an additional measure, authorities have extended the lockdown in Herat by three more weeks, with Monday being the third day since the curfew was enforced in Kabul, too.\n\nThe move, however, has failed to allay the fears of residents who said they were worried about their future.\n\n“We are concerned about the spread of the virus. We know it is a global issue, which came from China to Iran and from there to here … These Afghans went to Iran for survival or economic needs. Now, they are fleeing Iran for Afghanistan to remain alive and do not know if they are contaminated,” Fateh Shah, a shopkeeper in Kabul, said, adding: “All we can do is to pray and take measures not to get affected.”",

The paper discusses a carbon-pricing mechanism, renewable energy target, and other existing and emerging policies, as well as the implications of the current policy package for the country’s GHG trajectory. We find that, if fully implemented, Australia’s climate policy framework enables the country to achieve the full range of its international commitments to reduce emissions by 5-25 percent from 2000 levels by 2020.\n\nKey Findings\nThe key risks to Australia’s achievement of its emission targets are:\n\nOngoing policy uncertainty: Investment in low-emission technologies is likely to be deterred by policy uncertainty around the future of Australia’s carbon-pricing mechanism and the LRET. The repeal of the carbon-pricing mechanism by a Coalition government would exacerbate this problem unless the Coalition establishes a credible alternative carbon-price signal. In the absence of such a signal, investments that go ahead will attract higher risk premiums, increasing the cost of the low-carbon transition in Australia.\n\nOver-reliance on international markets: Currently low relative prices in the EU ETS and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) would encourage Australian emitters to purchase international permits instead of reducing emissions within Australia. This practice could stymie domestic emission reductions, increasing Australia’s reliance on imported emission permits. This situation, in turn, increases the exposure of the Australian economy to volatility in international carbon prices and slows the transition needed to achieve longer-term domestic transformation. Maintaining limits on international imports and direct domestic policy interventions to reduce emissions and boost energy efficiency (for example, stronger vehicle emission standards, regulatory approaches to limit fugitive emission increases, energy efficiency obligations on large energy users) would reduce these risks.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThis report outlines Australia’s policy framework for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, identifies areas of potential change in the near term, and attempts to evaluate the impact of current policies on Australia’s emissions trajectory to 2020. It assesses Australia’s international commitments, and the major policies of federal and state institutions to reduce emissions. It also assesses the likely success of these policies in achieving Australia’s emissions reduction goals. Australia has bipartisan political support for its international commitment to reduce emissions by 5–25 percent from 2000 levels by 2020, but very little bipartisan agreement as to how to achieve these reductions. The Clean Energy Act 2011 (and associated legislation known together as the Clean Energy Future package) implemented by the current federal government comprises a three-year fixed carbon price followed by a cap-and-trade scheme linked to the European Union (EU) emissions trading scheme and some Kyoto mechanisms. The federal government plans to change the legislation to bring forward the start of the cap-and-trade scheme to July 2014. When the trading scheme starts, annual caps on Australian emissions will be set by the federal government following recommendations by the independent Climate Change Authority (CCA). At this point, Australian entities will be able to use European and to a lesser extent Kyoto permits to meet up to 50 percent of their emissions liabilities, with the balance required to be domestically sourced permits. Full bilateral trading with the EU is intended to start in 2018.\n\nIn addition to this carbon-pricing mechanism, central federal policies are the Large-Scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) of 41,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) renewable energy generation by 2020, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), which has $A10 billion to assist deployment of low-emission technologies, and the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI), which is expected to have relatively little impact in the short term but significant long-term potential. State-based policies include feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaic (PV), energy efficiency obligations, and laws regulating land clearing.\n\nThe federal Opposition, two center-right parties in long-standing partnership known as the Coalition, has promised to rescind the carbon-pricing mechanism—both the fixed price and the emissions trading scheme (ETS)—and dismantle the CCA and the CEFC. The Coalition proposes to review the RET in 2014, despite a 2012 review by the CCA that warned further biennial reviews would increase investment uncertainty. The Coalition proposes to replace the carbon-pricing mechanism with a fund to purchase emissions abatement via reverse auctions, but has provided little information on how this would operate or achieve Australia’s target range. Legislative obstacles may prevent the removal of the current carbon-pricing framework.\n\nAssuming the Clean Energy Future package remains in place, Australia is able to achieve its full target range, if it so chooses.\n\nHowever, the degree to which this achievement relies on the purchase of international permits as opposed to emissions reduction within Australia depends on a range of factors, including the influence of European permit prices on Australia’s carbon price, the maintenance of the LRET, the winding back of state-based land-clearing laws and the implementation of policies under investigation such as light vehicle emission standards and a national energy saving obligation. Under current policies and prices, the Australian government projects that domestic emissions will increase, and the country would achieve its targets by purchasing international abatement. Recent changes to electricity consumption have not been factored into these projections.",

    "content": "The ongoing battle between Fortnite's dueling communities has a new front: the in-game currency known as \"V-Bucks.\" \n\nWhile Fortnite might be more recognized for its PvP Battle Royale mode, it's actually just one mode of a single game alongside the original PvE mode known as 'Save the World.' As such, the two modes share a game client, as well an in-game currency called V-Bucks. While V-Bucks can be purchased for money, it can also be earned in PvE, leading some PvP players to use this shared economy to their advantage, farming PvE games to earn V-Bucks to spend again in PvP. And it's causing some problems. Like a lot of games these days, Fortnite features a loot system where players can grind and earn in-game currency to purchase various loot, or buy in-game currency using real money for faster access. There's no way to \"earn\" V-Bucks in Battle Royale. Instead Epic has a system utilizing season passes that Battle Royale players can purchase to earn exclusive content. But Battle Royale players can still just buy V-Bucks to purchase cosmetics from from the store too if they're strapped for time. \n\nThat's where the Save the World mode comes in. For PvE players, a small amount of V-Bucks are awarded on a semi-regular basis. Yet thanks to Fortnite's shared V-Bucks economy, Battle Royale players are choosing to grind out V-Bucks in Save the World to then spend elsewhere, which is creating further rifts in the already split community. \n\nSave the World players feel their preferred mode keeps getting flooded with fairweather players who have no vested interest in the wider mechanics of PvE. Instead, they are just using Save the World to scrape and save V-Bucks earned in daily logins or quests. Players who are away from their keyboards and players who can't commit to the rigors of co-op play are problematic because the game is heavily reliant on working together. \n\nThere are even guides, subreddit threads, and whole websites dedicated to teaching Battle Royale players how to earn free V-Bucks from farming the PvE Save the World mode, like freethevbucks.com. \n\nEven then it's not particularly easy to farm V-Bucks in Save the World. One user who messaged us says that, \"it's a pain to grind out V-Bucks in [Save the World]. You earn 100 or less V-Bucks per quest and only certain quests give out V-Bucks as a reward. I have made a little under 3K V-Bucks in about a month.\" Since skins in Battle Royale cost anywhere from about 800 to 2,000 V-Bucks (1,000 V-Bucks retails for $9.99) that's about one or two skins a month. For some Battle Royale players, it's apparently preferable to just spend $20 on V-Bucks than play a cooperative game mode. One thread in the Fortnite Battle Royale subreddit thread simply titled \"Don't buy Save the World just to farm [V-Bucks]\" warns some players to stay away. \"If you can't enjoy a cooperative game about building stuff and waking zombies, don't buy it... Just spend [$20] on V-Bucks.\" \n\nIf players treated the two modes as part of the same game and played both in earnest, this might not be a problem. But there's clearly a divide between the two modes and how the players treat the other game mode. As a result we get PvP players outright dismissing the PvE mode as just a source for V-Bucks. Even then, there are those with so little interest that they'd rather just spend real-money to purchase their desired skins than play Save the World. \n\nIn a message through Reddit, a Battle Royale player tells USgamer, \"I would say that for members of the community who play both modes, it's probably common to log on to [Save the World], do your daily quest for the V-Bucks, and then switch over to [Battle Royale].\" \n\n\"I'll admit that now a big part of my motivation for playing [Save the World] is earning those V-Bucks that I can use for cosmetics in PvP,\" another Redditor says when asked why they still play PvE. The farming aspects of the game add fuel to calls that the two modes should be separate games altogether, with separate game clients, and maybe even currencies. A thread, this time on the PvE Fortnite subreddit, calls for this exact thing in Battle Royale and Save the World in order to discourage farming and \"leeching\" behavior out of fear that the latter is just a farming ground for V-Bucks. But that doesn't seem likely as this shared V-Bucks economy most likely works in Epic's favor. \n\nBy having a way to farm V-Bucks in one mode but not the other, it's likely that Battle Royale players who get to play the PvP mode for free will be tempted to purchase a paid copy of the Save the World game, keeping both modes busy with daily logins and players, even if it's just to help one group of players purchase outfits and cosmetics. \n\nThe most optimistic outcome of the shared V-Bucks economy is getting the two camps of players to play the other mode regularly and properly, the likely ideal scenario here. And in-between the more extreme sides of the divide are players who mainly play Save the World, but choose to spend their V-Bucks in Battle Royale, or Battle Royale players that commit to Save the World matches in earnest. \n\nWe reached out to Epic Games to ask what the developer's plans are for V-Bucks once Save the World does go free-to-play, but the company declined to comment. What's clear though is that the schism between Battle Royale and Save the World players hasn't healed in recent months. The Fortnite Save the World and Battle Royale community have already split their subreddits, and some hardcore players are demanding that the game modes themselves be split from one another entirely. \n\nA lot of that stems from resentment that Save the World has been put on the backburner so that primary focus can shift to Battle Royale, a mode that launched for free whereas Save the World was sold under a complicated and potentially expensive early access buy-in. When Save the World does eventually become free-to-play, there is also the fear that the mode will be completely relegated as a V-Bucks farming ground for the much larger Battle Royale playerbase lest changes are made. \n\nSince Battle Royale and Save the World are actually just two modes for the same basic game, this relationship where one side benefits off the other feels potentially dangerous. Hopefully the V-Bucks system will eventually be balanced so that Fortnite players can share in an economy that helps both game modes grow, or it risks creating a system where one mode leeches off the other.",

    "content": "Malaysia has arrested more than 4,000 people for violating virus lockdown orders, marking the toughest law enforcement action in Southeast Asia after the Philippines, where the president encourages police to shoot offenders.\n\nMalaysia is entering what it calls a “harsh mode” or a harsher phase of its official Movement Control Order to keep citizens in isolation and curb the spread of coronavirus, which threatens both the economy and human rights.\n\nPolice set up hundreds of roadblocks, have been conducting inspections, and have arrested thousands, including one man who jumped into the Strait of Malacca to avoid arrest, according to the government news service Bernama.\n\n“At first, the police enforcement was done in the soft and advisory mode, then it changed into the stern mode, and now it has entered the harsh mode,” Bernama quoted Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, the senior minister for security, as saying at a press conference Thursday. “So I hope the people will adhere to the MCO.”\n\nLockdown enforcement around the world has ranged from Florida charging a pastor who violated orders against mass gatherings, to Australia fining citizens who gather in groups of two or more.\n\nBut Malaysia reports one of the highest arrest rates, with 4,189 people arrested for loitering since March 18, including 1,449 charged in court. The rate is higher in the Philippines, where police arrested more than 20,000 lockdown violators, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said to “shoot them dead” if needed.\n\nMalaysia said its lockdown is decreasing the spread of COVID-19. It has reported 3,116 total cases and 50 deaths as of Friday.\n\nGoogle published data showing how much mobility has changed in each nation amid lockdown, using cell phone data. Malaysia saw the presence of citizens at retail and recreation sites decrease by 81% on Sunday, compared with about a month earlier, according to Google.\n\nThe law enforcement actions have included a crackdown on speech, however, that activists worry could threaten human rights, as the former ruling party that ran Malaysia for all except two years of its modern history returns to power.In addition to lockdown violators, the authorities have arrested people for allegedly spreading misinformation online about the virus. Journalists say they are self-censoring news about the virus to avoid punishment from the government.\n\n“Human rights workers, free expression advocates, bloggers, software developers, and activists are all in danger when government uses leeway obtained during a crisis to curtail free expression far beyond what’s required,” said Jason Kelley, a digital strategist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for an open internet.\n\nHe noted in a blog post that Malaysia is among several governments arresting people for alleged misinformation, and he says many of those arrested are activists.\n\nEconomists say the political turmoil in Kuala Lumpur will make it hard for the government to fight the coronavirus. Mahathir Mohamad, who became prime minister again in 2018 thanks mostly to the 1MDB corruption scandal that sank the prior regime, tried to consolidate power in February. His failure caused a political crisis until the old ruling party stepped into the power vacuum in March.\n\nWith the old party back in power, the government has started to stabilize, but the virus is still threatening the economy. Malaysia is one of the first three economies in the region, in addition to Singapore and Thailand, to predict a recession this year because of the coronavirus.\n\nIn response, the government announced last week the “People's Economic Stimulus Package,” locally abbreviated as PRIHATIN, to deal with COVID-19. The package includes $57.3 billion worth of cash aid, loans, deferred taxes and debt payments, along with other aid.\n\n“The sheer size of PRIHATIN signals the seriousness and sincerity in the government's approach,” said Jason Liang and Krystal Ng, partners at law firm Wong & Partners, in a joint assessment. “These measures ought to be far-reaching and should provide a source of encouragement and relief.”",

(KGO) -- The economic toll of our state's wildfires is still being calculated, but early estimates peg it at $10 billion so far.\n\nCan this continue year after year without a major change in policies and in forest management? Climate change experts at Stanford have been studying the problem.The question becomes how much will it cost to create policies and prevention programs to manage the growing devastation caused by wildfires that grow in size and intensity by the year.\"We spend about $2.5 billion on CAL FIRE firefighting in the State of California each year,\" said Michael Wara, Ph.D., a Stanford climate policy researcher. \"If we spend about that much money, we could do a lot to make this problem much less of a kind of frontline crisis.\"\n\nWara and other fellows at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research see fuel management as the critical step.Years of ground vegetation have accumulated through the years, growing much the way weeds take over yards that aren't maintained.\n\n\"We know that a warming climate dries out fuels and makes these large fires much more likely,\" said Marshall Burke, Ph.D., an agriculture and resource economist. \"So without federal leadership on climate change, over the long run, this problem is likely to only get worse.\"Economists say it will take a combined federal, state and local effort. An estimated 10 to 20 million acres need to be cleared at a possible cost of up to $1,000 per acre. Who will pay is one hurdle. Another is whether logging might help to generate funds, but that is controversial.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom this week signed an executive order to preserve 30 percent of state lands, but even that plan is expected to take the state two years to develop policies.Prescribed burns to clear brush also pose a challenge because of smoke, which created health hazards as it spread and stayed over wide areas. However, Native tribes that traditionally use fire to control wildfires demonstrated its effectiveness at the Creek Fire.\n\n\"The fire burned much less intensely, was much less damaging, produced much less smoke, and was the kind of fire that firefighters can stop, you know, can stop from burning into a town,\" Wara said.",

    "content": "KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Bhutanese refugees began arriving in the United States on Tuesday, the first wave of what the United Nations describes as one of the world's largest resettlement efforts.\n\nThe U.S. has offered to resettle 60,000 of the estimated 107,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin now living in seven U.N. camps in southeastern Nepal -- their home for the past 17 years. Six other nations -- Australia, Canada, Norway, Netherlands, New Zealand and Denmark -- have offered to resettle 10,000 each.\n\n\"Once they arrive, they will be sent to different cities around the U.S.,\" said David Derthick, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, which is screening and transporting the refugees.\n\nThe first group, arriving throughout the week, includes 121 refugees. They are being sent to New York; Chicago, Illinois; Syracuse, New York; St. Louis, Missouri; and other cities, the International Organization for Migration said.\n\nThe United Nations said several families had arrived in New York as of Tuesday, and more are en route to locations in Texas, Arizona and Maryland.\n\nSo far, however, only about 25,000 of the refugees have registered for resettlement, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Web site, and not many more than 10,000 are expected to leave Nepal by the end of the year.\n\nBhutan, wedged between China and India, is a Buddhist kingdom about half the size of the U.S. state of Indiana. It's considered one of the world's most isolated countries and the government strictly regulates foreign influences, including tourism, to preserve the country's Buddhist culture.The country had no electricity, paved roads, cars, telephones or postal service until the 1960s. It allowed access to television and the Internet only in 1999.\n\nBhutan stripped the minority ethnic Nepalis of their citizenship and forced them into exile in the early 1990s, allegedly in an attempt to ensure a homogenous culture, according to the independent, nongovernmental group Human Rights Watch. Many of the Nepalis have taken up arms and joined with violent Maoist rebels, the group said.\n\nThe refugees claim they were forced to leave Bhutan by security forces, but Bhutan has disputed whether all are truly refugees.\n\nSome 15 rounds of talks between Nepal and Bhutan have failed to resolve the issue.\n\nThe United States' resettlement plan has divided the refugee community, as members disagree over whether it is best to resettle in the United States or hang onto hopes of returning to Bhutan.\n\nA report posted on the UNHCR Web site quotes refugees who have chosen to go to the United States.\n\n\"We chose to resettle because there was no other outlet,\" said refugee Jay Narayan Adhikari. \"Talks between Nepal and Bhutan have produced no results.\"\n\n\"Everyone says 'America, America, America,' but I don't know much about it,\" said his wife, Sita, according to the U.N. report. \"It's only for the sake of the children that we are ready to go.\"\n\nNearby, the Bajgai family was separating because of its large size. Three children were leaving first, to be joined by the others later, the report said. Two of the daughters were crying as they packed their bags, but their mother told them: \"Why are you crying? We have nothing here anyway. We will join you soon. Our future will be brighter there.\"\n\nOf the 25,000 who have registered for resettlement, more than 12,000 names have been submitted for consideration for host countries, mainly the United States, the UNHCR said. More refugees are expected to register after they hear how those in the first group have been integrated into new homes, it said.\n\nBhutan became the world's newest democracy on Monday when an election ended more than 100 years of royal rule in the South Asian nation.Officials in Bhutan declared the first elections in the Himalayan kingdom a resounding success.\n\nOfficials said 79.4 percent of the country's 318,465 registered voters went to the polls -- a surprisingly large turnout for a populace that had largely said they preferred to remain under the rule of their revered king.\n\nBut many Bhutanese changed their minds after former King Jigme Singye Wangchuck went around the country pitching his case for the elections.",

    "content": "There are any number of ways to describe Leah Sargent. She’s an outspoken Madisonian conservative and anti-abortion advocate. She loves God, country music, and Tim Tebow, presumably in that order.\n\nBut there’s one thing she’s clearly not: a spammer.\n\nOn May 23, however, Sargent had her Twitter account suspended for five days. Her offense? Apparently, “tweeting snark on the #MoviesWithObama hashtag,” Sargent, editor of the site Misfit Politics, told the Daily Dot. “[M]ultiple people falsely reported me for spam when that’s obviously not what I’m doing.”\n\nIn 2012, Twitter has become a hotly contested political battleground, with users fighting to control not only the message—but the medium itself. There have been an alarming number of instances where users have allegedly abused Twitter’s spam reporting feature to have unwanted voices, like that of Sargent, barred temporarily from the service.\n\nFor example, Chris Loesch, the husband of a conservative talk-radio host, had his account suspended at least four times after defending his wife on Twitter and subsequently being labeled as spam by her critics.\n\nThe problem boils down to Twitter’s one-size-fits-all approach to combating spam—a massive issue that’s already caused the company to file for $700,000 in damages against five prominent spamware providers.\n\nWith more than 500 million users, there are obvious limits to Twitter’s ability to manually oversee accounts. That’s where automated systems come into play, allowing users to identify and report spam to help facilitate the removal process. On its help pages, Twitter has a list of some of the things it defines as spam. These include posting harmful links, following and unfollowing en masse for attention, spamming trending topics, and sending unwelcome tweets using the @mention feature. Personal opinions, it should be noted, are not classed as spam under Twitter’s guidelines.\n\nBy reporting a user as spam—a feature available on the drop-down menu of individual accounts—it prevents that user from being able to contact you on the site, and it also makes Twitter aware that person may be spamming others. In short, if an undetermined number of users decide to falsely flag a user for offensive content or spam, it can it can trick Twitter into automatically suspending the account in question.\n\n“Twitter has automated systems that find and remove multiple automated spam accounts in bulk,” a Twitter spokesperson wrote via email to Daily Dot contributor Lorraine Murphy, a recent victim of a Twitter spam-report attack. (Twitter did not respond to requests for comment for this story.)\n\nThe pattern is similar to what occurs on YouTube, where users abuse the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) request process to have videos temporarily banned. Since pre-screening videos would cost the Google-owned company an estimated $37 billion a year, YouTube employs a “pull first, investigate later” policy to comply with DMCA requests—legitimate or not.\n\nOn Twitter, suspended account go through a review process that allows users to appeal the decision. Community members appeal the decision, but it can take several days for a suspended account to be restored. (While setting up a new Twitter account is a simple process, people obviously don’t want to lose their existing identities and the connections they’ve cultivated over time.)\n\n“Twitter’s algorithm should not allow for abuse of the spam button, but no system is perfect,” Jillian C. York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the Daily Dot.\n\n“I believe that it’s the responsibility of the company to ensure that their system cannot be ‘gamed’ by users, rather than the responsibility of users to use the system correctly.”\n\nHaving an account suspended may be only a temporary victory, but it’s symbolic of a larger power struggle.\n\nOther conservatives have fallen victim to such attacks, in what some are referring to as the “#TwitterGulag.” A search for that hashtag reveals several instances of conservative-minded Twitter users claiming a “small, but loud” group of liberal tweeters are specifically targeting their accounts. Even actor Adam Baldwin has taken note of the trend.\n\nAnd this issue is not limited to American politics.\n\nMayoral candidate Chad Novak, who is campaigning on a “progressive change” platform in Regina, Saskatchewan, had his Twitter account suspended for at least the second time after his account was apparently marked as spam by the incumbent administration. (It has since has been reinstated.)\n\nIn Mexico last month, 30 spambots flooded Twitter with messages using the same hashtag as protesters against Institutional Revolutionary Party leader Pena Nieto, #marchaAntiEPN, causing it to be flagged by Twitter as spam and thus preventing the effort “from reaching the site’s coveted ‘Trending Topics’ list,” Univision reported.  A similar tactic was employed last year by spambots in Russia to drown out protesters’ tweets.\n\nThe overall trend that emerges is a new form of dirty politics, a micro-battle being waged in 140 characters or less.\n\nAnd as the self-proclaimed “free-speech wing of the free-speech party,” Twitter needs to be more active in protecting the voices of its constituents, Sargent contends.\n\n“[Twitter administrators] either need to change the system so that they can see who’s doing this, or if they can tell already, they need to suspend their sorry butts permanently,” she said.\n\n“They need to make it clear that abusing the spam report system isn’t going to be tolerated, and right now they’re doing the exact opposite.”",

    "content": "Today NOAA issued the scheduled update for its 2017 hurricane season outlook. Forecasters are now predicting a higher likelihood of an above-normal season, and they increased the predicted number of named storms and major hurricanes. The season has the potential to be extremely active, and could be the most active since 2010.\n\nForecasters now say there is a 60-percent chance of an above-normal season (compared to the May prediction of 45 percent chance), with 14-19 named storms (increased from the May predicted range of 11-17) and 2-5 major hurricanes (increased from the May predicted range of 2-4). A prediction for 5-9 hurricanes remains unchanged from the intial May outlook.  “We’re now entering the peak of the season when the bulk of the storms usually form,” said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. “The wind and air patterns in the area of the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean where many storms develop are very conducive to an above-normal season. This is in part because the chance of an El Nino forming, which tends to prevent storms from strengthening, has dropped significantly from May.”\n\nBell noted other factors that point to an above-normal season include warmer waters across the tropical Atlantic than models previously predicted and higher predicted activity from available models.\n\nIn just the first nine weeks of this season there have been six named storms, which is half the number of storms during an average six-month season and double the number of storms that would typically form by early August. An average Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1-November 30, produces 12 named storms, of which six become hurricanes, including three major hurricanes.“Today’s updated outlook underscores the need for everyone to know their true vulnerabilities to storms and storm surge,” said FEMA Administrator Brock Long. “As we enter the height of hurricane season, it’s important for everyone to know who issues evacuation orders in their community, heed the warnings, update their insurance and have a preparedness plan.”\n\nThe updated outlook is based on the current and evolving atmospheric and oceanic conditions, the most recent model predictions, and pre-and early-season storm activity. The numbers announced today include the season activity to-date. The Atlantic basin has seen six named storms (Arlene in April; Bret and Cindy in June; Don and Emily in July; and Franklin in August). Two of these storms, Cindy and Emily, struck the United States. Cindy made landfall on June 22 at the Louisiana-Texas border and caused heavy rain, inland flooding and multiple tornado outbreaks. Emily made landfall on July 31 in Anna Maria Island, Florida. Franklin is predicted to make landfall in Mexico overnight as a hurricane.\n\nToday’s update also decreases the chance of a near-normal season from 35 percent to 30 percent, and a below-normal season from 20 percent to only 10 percent from the initial outlook issued in May.\n\nAs we move into the peak of hurricane season, when hurricanes are most frequent and at their strongest, NOAA urges coastal residents to make sure they have their hurricane preparedness plans in place and to monitor the latest forecasts.",

    "content": "Ben­­-Gurion Airport is quiet with civilian flights almost at a standstill. However, cargo flights on the Azerbaijan route have been very busy over the last two weeks. The high number of flights is a direct result of the renewal of fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. No fewer than four Ilyushin­­-76 planes, operated by the Azeri cargo airline Silk Way, which serves the Azeri defense ministry, have touched down and taken off from the Uvda air base in southern Israel – two, before the outbreak of fighting, and two, afterwards. According to flight regulations, that is the only airport from which planes loaded with explosive material are allowed to take off.\n\nThe monitoring of takeoffs and landings and the movement of planes across the Middle East and outside the region is done by professionals and amateurs alike. One of these is my colleague Avi Scharf, the editor-in-chief of the English edition of Haaretz. The four Azeri planes flew directly from Baku to Uvda and back, their flight path documented on various open websites that monitor air traffic. Some of these planes also flew from Baku to Ankara and Istanbul and back over the last two weeks.\n\nFourth Azeri heavylifter in less than a week heading (prob) Israel AF base down south.The fighting resumed on September 27 with a surprise Azeri attack along the entire front. At least 300 people, including men in uniform and civilians, have been killed so far. Both sides are using artillery, tanks and airstrikes (by helicopters and drones) against towns and villages. People are in shelters or cellars; some have already moved to more secure locations, while others are still fleeing.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is a 4.400-square-kilometer (1,700-square-mile) enclave with a population of 150,000. It is situated in the heart of Azerbaijan, but most of the population are Christian Armenians, with only a minority of Azeris or Turks. The enclave is a result of a Soviet tradition, the aim of which was to pursue a policy of divide-and-rule. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenia tried using peaceful methods in order to transfer the enclave to its sovereignty, but this met with opposition. War broke out between the two countries in 1988 over control of this enclave. This intensified in 1991 and lasted for three years, and included ethnic cleansing and a massacre of Armenians in Baku. Thirty thousand people died, and one million lost their homes.\n\nA cease­­­-fire was declared in the enclave in 1994, with borders determined, but since then, all international efforts to reach a permanent solution have been in vain. The Armenians in the enclave declared an independent state called the Republic of Artsakh, which has not been recognized by any country, not even Armenia. The relative quiet reigning there over the last 25 years was breached from time to time with border incidents flaring up, or with short exchanges of fire. This is not the case this time, not in the extent of forces involved or in the intensity of fighting. This conflict is a classic geographical, historical, religious and ethnic one, but it exceeds the boundaries of the Caucasian region, interfacing with the battle between Shi’ite Iran and Turkey over regional hegemony, all under the eyes of Big Brother, namely Russia.\n\nStrange bedfellows\n\nIn trying to describe the conduct of the parties involved in this fight, a cynical observer might quote from “The Tempest,” Shakespeare’s last play: “Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.” This is how Turkey and Israel, currently hostile to one another (with Recep Tayyip Erdogan stating only last week that Jerusalem belongs to the Moslems), find themselves both supporting Azerbaijan, a Shi’ite Moslem country. On the other side, Iran, a third of whose population is of Azeri extraction (including its Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei), is supporting Christian Armenia and, according to some reports, supplying it with weapons. Russia, which has a military base in Armenia, is trying to please everyone, arming Azerbaijan as well. The same pattern of behavior characterizes the Kremlin’s policy in Syria, with Vladimir Putin assisting the regime of Bashar Assad and the Iranians, while providing Israel with “silent encouragement” for carrying out air strikes against Iranian positions, Hezbollah and Shi’ite militias. Greece, a strategic ally of Israel, currently in conflict with Turkey over the transport of natural gas in the eastern Mediterranean basin, is supporting Armenia.This is indeed a seriously muddled issue. One other issue that should worry Israel and any other conscientious Jew is that Israel, the state of a people that was murdered in the Holocaust, is refusing to recognize the massacre of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, a genocide avant la lettre. For years, this position was adopted in order not to annoy Turkey, which for 50 years was Israel’s strategic ally against Syria and, later, Iran. The Mossad and Turkish intelligence cooperated with each other, with Israel’s defense industries selling arms to Turkey for billions of dollars. Ironically, among the systems sold to Turkey were drones and technology which helped Turkey build a comparable industry. Turkish Bayraktar drones are now in action in Nagorno-Karabakh’s battlefields, as well as in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Turkey, which declared a policy of zero-conflict with its neighbors in the past, is currently in conflict with all of them, or at least involved in their wars.\n\nOpen gallery view\nThe dismantling of the strategic alliance between Turkey and Israel is a systematic and deliberate process, begun by Erdogan a decade and a half ago. Yet Israel has not used this as an opportunity to fulfill its historic duty and follow its conscience and values regarding the Armenian genocide. The reason for this is Azerbaijan. At the same time that Erdogan started distancing himself from Israel, Azerbaijan and Israel grew closer. It soon became clear that the two countries had set up a strategic alliance centered on their mutual hostilities towards Iran.\n\nFour years ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went on a snap visit to Baku, during which the Azeri president, Ilham Aliyev, a tyrant who violates human rights and harshly suppresses any opposition, revealed that Azerbaijan had purchased weapons from Israel to the tune of $5 billion.Mossad keeps an eye on Iran from Azerbaijan\n\nMoreover, according to foreign sources, the Mossad established a station in Azerbaijan, serving as the “eyes, ears and a springboard” for monitoring Iran. According to these reports, Azerbaijan prepared an airfield that would assist Israel in case it attacked Iran. Other reports claimed that the Iranian nuclear archive that was stolen by Mossad agents in Tehran two and a half years ago was smuggled to Israel through Azerbaijan. According to some reports, Israel’s aerospace industries, Elbit, Rafael and other smaller companies are selling Baku just about anything. This includes artillery (a few years ago I discovered a questionable revolving deal between Elbit and the Czech Republic and Slovakia; this too involved the Uvda airport); missiles, naval vessels, intelligence equipment and a large number of drones. Almost all the Israeli companies that make drones, including attack or self-destructing (“kamikaza” ones), have sold their wares to the Azeri army. Armenian spokesmen have said in the past that some of these, including ones made by Aeronautics Ltd., were downed during incidents along the border with Azerbaijan.\n\n“For you this is trading in arms, but for us these are death weapons”, Armenia’s foreign minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan told me in an interview a year and a half ago, when I visited Armenia. Despite this, he expressed his wish for improved relations with Israel, hoping that this would lead to an Israeli recognition of the Armenian genocide. At that time, there was some warming in relations. Armenia opened an embassy in Tel Aviv, with a non-resident Israeli ambassador appointed to Armenia. Charter flights between the two countries were launched and there was some attempt to promote trade. These attempts are now imploding with the resumed fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia’s ambassador to Israel, who was on home leave, was told to remain there, in a typical act of diplomatic censure. Armenia’s President Armen Sarkissian called President Reuven Rivlin on Monday, expressing his concern over the continued sale of Israeli weapons to Azerbaijan. Rivlin expressed his regret over the outbreak of hostilities and noted that Israel has had a long-dstanding relationship with Azerbaijan, adding that their cooperation was not directed at any other country.Yesterday, the Armenian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Anna Naghdalyan had this to say, in conversation with Haaretz: “Armenia has consistently raised the issue of arm supplies from Israel to Azerbaijan. Most recently, during the July aggression of Azerbaijan against Armenia, the Foreign Minister stated clearly that Israel should stop this deadly business with Azerbaijan.\n\n“For sure, the provision of modern weapons by Israel to Azerbaijan is unacceptable for us. We have repeatedly informed our Israeli counterparts about this through diplomatic channels; it should be noted that it is especially painful at a time when Azerbaijan, with the support of Turkey, is carrying out a large-scale aggression against Artsakh and Armenia.\n\n“Instead, these days, when the whole international community calls on the Azerbaijani side to stop hostilities, the Israeli side continues to supply weapons to Azerbaijan. These armaments are being delivered against the civilian populations and civilian infrastructure of Artsakh and Armenia.These kind of actions are unacceptable for us, especially in this period. Based on the current situation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to recall the Ambassador of Armenia to Israel for consultations.”\n\nIt’s hard to expect that Israel, which always decries rockets launched against civilians by Hezbollah and Hamas, will change its ways. Another country may have declared a suspension of shipments, even temporarily. In anything related to the Holocaust, to historical memory and to the sale of weapons, the hypocrisy of Israeli governments over the years is nothing new. The government’s current silence on the matter speaks volumes.\n\nThe ministries of defense and foreign affairs adamantly refused to relate to the issue.",

    "content": "The acquisition of Metro Transport Sydney by Transport for NSW heralds a new era for the administration and expansion of Sydney's light rail system.\n\nOn 23 March 2012, Transport for NSW acquired Metro Transport Sydney Pty Ltd (MTS), the company that owned and operated both the Sydney Light Rail and Sydney Monorail, for $19.8 million.\n\nThe acquisition was a first of its kind for Transport for NSW and now MTS and its subsidiary companies are under its control and form part of its portfolio. The Premier Barry O'Farrell and the Minister for Transport Gladys Berejiklian in March stated that it was \"enabling the efficient delivery of future light rail extensions and clearing the way for the removal of the monorail to accommodate the new convention centre at Darling Harbour\".\n\nThe acquisition has facilitated the award of a contract to John Holland for the construction of the Inner West Extension of the Sydney Light Rail, an extension of 5.6 kilometres of track from Lilyfield to Dulwich Hill in May 2012, and also the announcement of the monorail's closure on 30 June 2013 to make way for the Convention Centre Project.\n\nTransport for NSW is expected to release a Light Rail Strategic Plan, targeted for the middle of this year. It is intended to examine Transport for NSW's greater ambitions for light rail in Sydney, including the feasibility of extensions through the CBD, to Sydney University and the University of NSW.\n\nAlthough the acquisition of MTS was a unique move for Transport for NSW, on the other side of the globe, Transport for London has also been busy acquiring companies and restructuring financing arrangements on PPPs over the past few years.\n\nIn December 2008, Transport for London acquired two infrastructure companies known as Metronet after it spent a period in administration. Metronet had been responsible for two-thirds of the Tube modernisation works under PPP contracts.\n\nThen in June 2010, Transport for London acquired the Tube Lines group of companies for £220.2 million. The 30 year PPP contract with Tube Lines was a performance based contract for the maintenance and renewal of the remainder of the Tube assets, including stations, tracks, tunnels, signalling and rolling stock on specified lines. The plans to buy the companies followed months of disputes between Tube Lines and Mayor Boris Johnson over the cost of future upgrade works. In a statement released by the City Hall, Mayor Johnson said that the completion of the deal \"opens a new era for the Tube and one that will be free from the complexity and wrangling that hindered us in recent years.\"\n\nThrough this and the acquisition of Tube Lines, Transport for London now controls all of the maintenance and upgrade works for the Tube.\n\nIn November 2011, Transport for London also acquired the two companies responsible for the maintenance of the London City Airport and Woolwich Arsenal extensions of the Docklands Light Rail. Those extensions to the Docklands Light Rail had been funded under private finance initiative agreements. Transport for London named the \"unique circumstances of the organisation's ability to raise finance and also current market conditions\" as the reason by which, through Transport for London's investment, it could save up to £250 million by replacing the private sector financing costs with public sector borrowing.\n\nAgain, this transaction seems familiar to the NSW market. Late last year, the NSW Government announced that it was considering proposals for a financial restructure of Reliance Rail, the consortium engaged by the Government under a PPP contract for the delivery of 78 new Waratah trains for Sydney's CityRail network. In February this year the NSW Government agreed to invest $175 million in 2018 in return for 100 percent of the equity in Reliance Rail, conditional on the successful delivery of the 78 Waratah trains and Reliance Rail's ability to refinance its existing debt at that time.\n\nAs these recent examples show, there is often a need in long-term projects for flexibility to be responsive to changing circumstances, whether they be changes to policy objectives, the financial climate, technology or demand. Such flexibility will ensure that long-term projects can serve broader policy objectives as projects mature.\n\nIncluding appropriate contractual mechanisms to address the need for such flexibility will provide greater certainty for both Government and the private sector in terms of outcome and also price when circumstances require the parties to renegotiate aspects of the project. Although at the stage project contracts are developed it might seem like looking into a crystal ball to predict possible future needs, drawing from past experiences, and also considering the nature of the project itself, it is obvious that certain circumstances are more likely to arise than others. Contractual mechanisms can then be developed to provide avenues for dealing with these types of scenarios. For example, mechanisms to enable clear methods for pricing extensions, processes for competitively bidding project augmentations and methods for private party / Government refinancing would provide greater certainty for Government and the private sector when facing such changing circumstances.\n\nTime spent negotiating such mechanisms from the outset will be an investment in preserving flexibility for the future of a project.\n\nClayton Utz advised on both the Reliance Rail financial restructure and the acquisition of Metro Transport Sydney.",

They spent 40 hours perched at the top of the 180-metre chimney.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the head of PGE, Greenpeace Poland demanded that the coal utility giant phase out coal and pivot to renewables by 2030 at the latest. The environmental organization also urged PGE to drop plans to expand fossil fuel projects, including the Zloczew and Gubin-Brody lignite mines and the extension of the opencast mine in Turow. Should PGE fail to comply, Greenpeace warned that it would resort to legal action.\n\n“We will not stand by and watch pollution devastate our planet without taking action,” Paweł Szypulski said. “After protesting at the plant, we have written to PGE asking the coal utility to do what is needed to avoid a climate catastrophe. If PGE does not respond to these requests, we will take them to court.”\n\nContacted by Climate Home News, PGE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We need urgent and brave action, but state-controlled energy companies continue to invest in fossil fuels, because of irresponsible politicians shaping Polish energy policy,” Szypulski said.\n\nPoland overwhelmingly relies on coal for its energy, with 80% of its electricity currently generated by it. The government’s draft 2040 energy strategy, published on 23 November, projects retiring 17GW existing coal-fired plants and installing 4GW of onshore wind by 2035.\n\nCoal would remain the dominant source of power supply, with around 60% of generation fuelled by lignite in 2030.\n\nThe right-wing Law and Justice government has come under increasing pressure from environmental organizations over its support for coal, as it prepares to host the UN climate summit in Katowice from 3 until 15 December. Regularly repeating “Poland stands on coal”, the government has named PGE and coal rival Tauron as sponsors of Cop24.\n\nEnvironmentalists continue to pile pressure worldwide for governments to phase out the dirtiest of fossil fuels. The activist network 350.org is partnering with eight anti-coal campaigns in Senegal, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Thailand, Australia,  Turkey and Germany.",

The restrictions were eased at the end of May.\n\nThe bishops said that public Masses would be suspended from Jan. 23 -- the day before the country's presidential election -- along with catechesis and other pastoral activities that required people to gather. They called on priests to offer livestreamed Masses. \n\nThe bishops had called for the suspension or postponement of baptisms, confirmations, and marriages earlier this month.\n\nThey said that funerals could be celebrated according to norms issued in May last year, which require mourners to maintain a social distance.\n\nA Lenten retreat for the bishops, scheduled for Feb. 22-26, has also been canceled.\n\nThe Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which has been hit hard financially by the pandemic, will broadcast three Masses and two rosary prayers daily while public Masses are suspended. \n\nThe Masses, which will be transmitted via the shrine's website, will take place at 11 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. local time.

    "content": "A man was killed and two women were injured in a shooting Thursday afternoon in the lobby of Smith Tower Apartments in downtown Vancouver.\n\nThe suspected shooter, identified by police as Robert E. Breck, 80, a resident of the senior living building, was taken into custody after a standoff with law enforcement that lasted nearly 2 ½ hours.\n\nThe victims have not yet been identified. However, the two who were injured were transported to PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center, where a hospital spokesman said both were in satisfactory condition. \n\nBreck was booked into the Clark County Jail on suspicion of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder, according to the Vancouver Police Department. He will make a first appearance on the allegations Friday morning in Clark County Superior Court.\n\nHe allegedly fired shots in the building’s lobby shortly after 2 p.m. A 77-year-old man, who’s a resident and asked not to be identified, said he saw Breck enter the building through the side door. The witness entered through the same door a short time later. When he got inside, the witness said he saw Breck standing with a handgun in the lobby and heard “boom-boom.” The witness turned and fled. He went to the dress shop next door and called 911, he said. \n\nPolice were summoned at 2:09 p.m. to 515 Washington St., where they found three victims in the lobby suffering from gunshot wounds. Breck was holed up in his apartment on the building’s 13th floor on the south side.\n\nArmed SWAT officers swarmed the building. Teams of four officers, holding the victims’ arms and legs, carried them out the front door — one appeared to be dead. The injured victims were tended to in the building’s parking lot until paramedics arrived and transported them to the hospital.\n\nShortly after, witnesses to the shooting were ushered from the building by law enforcement and taken to City Hall to be interviewed.\n\nAfter police identified Breck as the suspect, a crisis negotiation team started communicating with him via phone before 3 p.m. SWAT officers evacuated the residents who were able to navigate the stairs and told the rest to shelter in place. The elevators inside the 15-story tower were shut off as police worked to contain the gunman to the 13th floor, where a drone hovered outside his window.At about 4:35 p.m., police led Breck out of the building. He was wearing a gray T-shirt, plaid pajama pants and a baseball cap.\n\nA few bystanders clapped and cheered as Breck was escorted to a patrol vehicle.\n\n“He was taken into custody without incident. … We are continuing the investigation into the whole incident,” Vancouver Police Department spokeswoman Kim Kapp said in a media briefing outside Smith Tower. Police have not released a motive.\n\n“We don’t have any information really related to what precipitated it,” she said. “That will be a big part of the investigation, to figure that out.”\n\nLaw enforcement did not fire their weapons during the incident, Kapp said.\n\nA 12th floor resident, who was friends with the man who was killed, said she watched SWAT officers walk past her door through the peep hole.\n\n“They had their guns drawn,” said the resident, who declined to give her name. “They said, ‘Stay in your apartment.’ ” She was later evacuated from the building through the garage. She said she saw her friend lying on the ground.\n\n“I had just been in the lobby with this guy,” she said, adding that he was on his way to sell a motorcycle and was dressed in leathers. “I took his picture. I said, ‘Oh, you’re looking like a stud.’ ”\n\nTrish Gatley, 74, said she was visiting a friend on the 10th floor at the time of the shooting. Unaware of what had happened, she walked downstairs to her ninth-floor apartment to grab her purse before work.\n\nTwo officers carrying guns told her to put her hands up, she said. They told her to stay calm and continue down the stairs. When she exited the building, she said she saw a man on the ground, as well as an injured woman being stabilized and put onto a stretcher.Evacuated residents were kept warm and dry in a C-Tran bus at Sixth and Washington streets. Some residents who sheltered in place looked down from their windows on the crowd gathering below. Law enforcement cordoned off a three-block radius around Smith Tower, with police vehicles bumper to bumper on surrounding streets. Area C-Tran bus routes were detoured during the response.\n\nPolice kept the area of Fifth and Sixth streets from Main to Washington streets closed for several hours after taking Breck into custody. Following a final sweep of the building, residents were given clearance to return to their apartments.\n\n“While we are still learning about what happened surrounding the shooting incident this afternoon in downtown Vancouver, our hearts go out to the victims and their families as they deal with this tragedy,” Vancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle said in a written statement. “I commend our police officers, fire and EMS personnel who quickly responded to the scene. I have the utmost confidence in our officers as they work to resolve the situation.”SHOOTING TIMELINE\nA man was killed and two women were injured Thursday afternoon in a shooting at Smith Tower Apartments in downtown Vancouver. The shooting prompted a roughly 2½-hour standoff.\n\nThe following is a summary of communications between emergency officials from emergency radio traffic monitored at The Columbian.\n\n2:09 p.m.\n\n•  Vancouver police officers are dispatched to Smith Tower, 515 Washington St., for a report of a disturbance with a weapon.\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\n•  Vancouver Fire Department and medical crews are dispatched amid reports of a shooting with multiple victims. A triage area is set up to receive victims.\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\n•  Residents shelter in place on the 13th floor.\n\n•  The suspect in the shooting, Robert E. Breck, 80, is confirmed to be alone inside his apartment on the 13th floor. In a phone call with negotiators, he says he is willing to surrender and doesn’t want to hurt anyone else.\n\n•  A C-Tran bus stages at Esther Short Park to evacuate residents.\n\n•  The tower is cleared up to the 11th floor.\n\n•  Two patients are taken to PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center.\n\n•  An officer requests that power be shut off on the 13th floor and that elevators are stopped.\n\n•  A negotiator says they are speaking with Breck about the surrender process.\n\n•  Breck hangs up, and a negotiator notes that the man is in the bathroom of the apartment.\n\n•  An officer says that anyone still inside their rooms may shelter in place and stay away from openings.\n\n•  An officer requests a door charge in case an explosive breach is necessary.\n\n•  Breck exits the front door of the apartment, refuses officer commands and re-enters.\n\n•  Officers want Breck to crawl out of the apartment on hands and knees. But the man claims he has a sickness “similar to Lou Gehrig’s disease,” making that difficult.\n\n•  An officer notes that police have probable cause for murder.\n\n•  Officers say that, when he surrenders, Breck should remove his shirt to ensure he is unarmed.\n\n•  Breck exits the apartment again, but he didn’t feel comfortable with the exchange and returns. A negotiator notes that Breck is “all about respect,” and officers should go easier on him. But Breck respects law enforcement and wants to surrender.\n\n  Breck admits to shooting subjects on purpose.\n\n•  Breck is seen at a window with his hands empty.\n\n•  Breck’s daughter keeps calling him, unaware of his involvement, and interrupts negotiations.\n\n•  Breck comes out of the apartment again and returns again.\n\n•  Police ask someone to contact the daughter.\n\n3:51 p.m.\n\n•  A female neighbor next door is sheltered in place.\n\n•  Negotiators attempt to distract Breck as they plan to evacuate her.\n\n•  Moments later, negotiators and Breck continue working out a surrender plan.\n\n4:02 p.m.\n\n•  Breck confirms that he knows one person is dead.\n\n•  An officer notes that “he’s pretty calm and coherent,” and he hasn’t shown signs of impairment.\n\n4:13 p.m.\n\n•  A U.S. Homeland Security team is on the 13th floor but not connected with local police communications. They are asked to leave.\n\n•  An ambulance is requested to stage outside the tower in case “any more patients are produced.”\n\n4:17 p.m.\n\n•  Evacuated residents are boarded onto a C-Tran bus. They are checked for injuries as they board.\n\n•  Negotiators note they are “working on some anxiety issues” with Breck.\n\n4:23 p.m.\n\n•  A door to the apartment suddenly opens. Moments later, Breck is in custody.\n\n4:26 p.m.\n\n•  Police enter the apartment to search for additional victims.\n\n•  Breck is led down an elevator and taken to a police vehicle.\n\n4:29 p.m.\n\n•  Breck’s apartment is cleared. No other victims are found.",

    "content": "Forty years after a ribbon was cut on Sydney's last major railway, thousands of passengers will flood through station gates today to ride on a new rail line set to change travel habits dramatically for people long starved of public transport options in the city's north-west.\n\nWhile double-deck trains began running on the Eastern Suburbs line on June 23, 1979,  single-deck trains controlled by a giant computer, instead of people, will speed at up to 100km/h along the Metro North West line from Rouse Hill to Chatswood.The most striking feature of the trains is that they are driverless, allowing passengers to peer out of windows at the front and back onto the tracks. At stations, glass screen doors on platforms help prevent injury, while help points allow commuters to talk to staff via video screens.\n\nIn all, a journey from one end of the 36 kilometre line to the other takes about 37 minutes. Most of the stations are about two kilometres apart, except for the six kilometres between North Ryde and Chatswood.\n\nThe high-tech nature of the line represents a step change for the city's public transport.\n\nAs passengers pile aboard today, network manager Cory Roeton will keep close watch with controllers over the line from a nerve centre at an enormous stabling yard at Rouse Hill. An array of CCTV cameras cover the inside of trains and stations.\"The heartbeat of the the railway is the [operations control centre]. Everything that goes on outside comes through this control centre,\" he said.\n\nIn a room next to the control centre sits a giant computer that controls the line and the trains which, for the first six weeks, will run every five minutes during peak periods. A back-up computer at a nearby site is ready to take over in the event of the main computer failing.\n\nMr Roeton said the computer system operates off-line, removing the chance of a cyber attack.\n\n\"It's not connected to anything else so you cannot penetrate the network. You cannot sit there and hack in and take control of the trains,\" he said.\"As the train runs, the [computer] is constantly working algorithms, calculations to define how the network is operating,\" he said. \"It is just constant calculation.\"\n\nThe highly automated system contrasts with Sydney's existing suburban rail system, which requires drivers to carry out preparation work and checks before the trains begin services each day.\n\nTransport Secretary Rodd Staples, the architect of Sydney's metro rail, said he understood some people's concerns about automation but cited the millions who travel on systems, such as the Metro North West, around the world \"very, very safely today\".\n\n\"It is absolutely safer than any railway we have ever had in Australia. There are so many fail-safe mechanisms within the computer system,\" he said.\"We are not the first to try this and, in fact, all of the statistics show these have the lowest amounts of safety incidents. Compared to everything else, this is absolutely the best.\"\n\nThe North West line is, from a technology perspective, most similar to Hong Kong's South Island line, albeit the next generation of the systems used on it.\n\n\"We have tended to look at proven technologies and have confidence in the safety because we want it to work really, really well. It gives us confidence that the operator has used the technology in Hong Kong themselves,\" Mr Staples said.\n\nThe line is Sydney's first privately operated line, run by Hong Kong's MTR.\n\nTravel on the new line is free for the public today when the gates open about 11am. The last metro train will leave Chatswood at 10.05pm and, from the other end of the line, from Tallawong Station at Rouse Hill at 9.35pm.",

    "content": "Het Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam pakt vanaf zaterdag uit met een grote tentoonstelling rond de Russische kunstschilder Kazimir Malevich (1879-1935) en zijn tijdgenoten. \n\nVerdeeld over zo'n dertien zalen zijn ruim 500 schilderijen, tekeningen en sculpturen te zien van een van de belangrijkste grondleggers van de abstracte kunst en van andere vernieuwende Russische kunstenaars.\n\n''Een liefhebber is minimaal acht uur kwijt om alle werken te bekijken'', zei conservator Bart Rutten donderdag. De tentoonstelling is in Nederland het culturele sluitstuk van het - inmiddels besmette - Ruslandjaar.\n\nHet Stedelijk hield voor het laatst een Malevich-tentoonstelling in 1989. Het museum heeft buiten Rusland de grootste verzameling werken van de kunstenaar in bezit. Voor deze nieuwe expositie hebben veel buitenlandse musea werken uitgeleend, die dat normaliter niet zo snel zouden doen. Rutten: ''Je komt er niet vanaf met één briefje en één telefoontje als je een Malevich wilt lenen.''\n\nWarm hart\nDe werken kwamen toch naar Amsterdam, omdat het museum de kunstenaar altijd een warm hart heeft toegedragen. In 1923 was het Stedelijk het eerste museum buiten Rusland waar Malevich te zien was. Nu komen enkele schilderijen zelfs van musea in steden in het Russische achterland, zoals Samara en Jekaterinenburg. ''Veel werken worden voor het eerst in het Westen getoond'', verklaarde Rutten.\n\nIn het Stedelijk kunnen bezoekers de carrière volgen van Malevich, die in het middelpunt staat van de expositie. ''In het begin was hij geen exceptionele kunstenaar, maar gewoon een meeloper'', lichtte Rutten toe.\n\n''Geleidelijk aan ontwikkelde hij zich tot een eigenzinnige, radicale vernieuwer, die ook tegenstand te verduren kreeg.'' In zijn abstracte werken gooide hij de zichtbare realiteit volledig overboord.\n\nKoningin Máxima zal de tentoonstelling vrijdag openen. De werken zijn tot februari te zien en reizen daarna door naar de Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn en het prestigieuze Tate Modern in Londen.",

Another 20 percent were Afghans, and 7 percent were Iraqis, IOM and the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said in a joint statement.\n\nPeople smuggling operations probably accounted for the majority of journeys and likely earned at least $1 billion, Swing said, taking “anywhere from $2,000 to maybe $6,000 depending on how many members of the family and depending on which smuggling ring it is”.\n\nIOM estimates people smugglers in Europe have made $10 billion or more since 2000, maybe much more. “They are certainly getting very well paid for their services,” Swing said.Out of a total of 1,005,504 arrivals to Greece, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, Malta and Cyprus by Dec. 21, the vast majority -- 816,752 -- arrived by sea in Greece, IOM said.\n\nIOM spokesman Joel Millman said it was impossible to forecast how the flow of migr“No wonder you have such a large flux coming north. This is an unprecedented scale of simultaneous complex protracted disasters from the western bulge of Africa to the Himalayas, with very few stable, peaceful spots in between.”\n\nU.N. refugee chief Antonio Guterres called on Friday for a “massive resettlement” of Syrian and other refugees within Europe, to distribute many hundreds of thousands of people before the continent’s asylum system crumbles.\n\nEditing by Dominic Evansnts would evolve in 2016.\n\n“So much is in the balance, the resolution of the Syrian war, and the disposition of the European border protection moves that are being contemplated,” he said.\n\n“We never thought it would reach this level. We just hope people are treated with dignity.”The record movement of people into Europe is a symptom of a record level of disruption around the globe, with numbers of refugees and internally displaced people far surpassing 60 million, UNHCR said last week.\n\nSwing said the war in Syria was only one among many causes, including Ebola and Boko Haram in West Africa, an earthquake in Nepal, conflicts in Libya, Yemen, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Afghanistan and Iraq.",

    "content": "Sara Medini, political analyst at the Tunisian feminist organisation Aswat Nissa, was in a meeting at work last week when she happened to glance at a news alert on her phone. What she saw left her at first flabbergasted, then delighted.\n\n“I couldn’t believe my eyes. I thought I had misread it,” she said. “I told my colleagues: ‘He’s appointed a woman! He’s appointed a woman!’\n\n“We were all delighted. We had goosebumps. It’s really a historic moment – but that doesn’t mean they have a blank cheque.”\n\nThe decision by the president, Kais Saied, to name Najla Bouden, a senior civil servant in the higher education ministry and lecturer in geological engineering, as the first female prime minister of Tunisia, or indeed of any Arab country, made waves around the world.At home, it was greeted with a mixture of emotions – not least relief by those who hope it is a step on the road back to normality after Saied’s shock move in July to sack his prime minister and suspend parliament in what many saw as a coup.\n\nThe jury is out, however, on what Bouden’s appointment will mean for Tunisian women.\n\n“The fact that a woman has been appointed is excellent; it’s a step forward [and] it breaks with stereotype. But it’s not sufficient. The political programme of the government – her government – must follow egalitarian principles,” said Medini.\n\n“She comes in at an incredibly critical moment. She has a lot of work to do.”\n\nFor decades Tunisia has been considered a standard-bearer for women’s rights in the Arab world, with a package of family laws – passed just months after independence in 1956 – abolishing polygamy and allowing women to file for divorce.\n\nWomen won the right to vote in 1957 and were able to run for office by 1959. In 2011, when the country led the first revolution of the so-called Arab spring, toppling the dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, women were on the barricades.\n\nBut some feel that progress towards full equality has stalled. Saied is against reforming laws to grant women equal inheritance rights, something the late president Beji Caid Essebsi said he would do – to the outrage of conservatives and religious figures.\n\nThere have been legislative victories since the revolution, notably a 2017 law aimed at cracking down on violence against women. But Medini said there was still a huge amount of work to be done “on a practical level” to ensure the changes were implemented.\n\nOn top of all this, Tunisia’s severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, has hit women disproportionately hard. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2020 gender inequality index, Tunisia dropped from 90th to 124th between 2006 and 2020.“[The crisis] has accentuated women’s economic weakness and thus accentuated their dependence on their families, on their husbands,” said Medini.\n\n“For example, a woman [who] is the victim of violence at the hands of her husband can’t escape the home or ask for a divorce, because she hasn’t the necessary money.”\n\nFor Halima Ouanada, an academic at the University of Tunis El Manar, some of the reactions last week to Bouden’s appointment were proof of the challenges still facing women in power.\n\n“Rather than dwelling on her role as university professor, on her good international reputation as an academic, following more than 13 years of experience in the management of large-scale projects, the debate turned into reflections on her gender: the price of her shoes, her glasses,” Ouanada wrote in Le Temps News\n\n“She was presented as the daughter of so-and-so and the wife of so-and-so … as if she owed nothing to herself, to her intelligence and perseverance.”\n\nBouden’s emergence into the spotlight did take many by surprise. Aged 63, she has spent her career at Tunisia’s higher education and scientific research ministry and as a university lecturer.\n\nBut Hèla Yousfi, sociology lecturer at Paris Dauphine University, said the appointment was not surprising, given Saied’s own background as a law professor turned politician.\n\n“Kais Saied was brought to power by a popular extra-parliamentary movement, which expressed its total mistrust of the political class,” said Yousfi. “So there is a consistency there with the nomination of someone from outside the political class. It’s consistent with the Tunisian people’s complete crisis of faith in the political class, which has failed for 10 years to fulfil the aspirations of the Tunisian revolution.”\n\nThere are fears that Bouden will have little room for manoeuvre. Saied has kept in place the emergency measures he introduced in July, in effect ensuring that the prime minister will be solely responsible to him. Some have predicted she will be a mere pawn of the president.Yousfi acknowledged the risk, but said it was too soon to tell how things would pan out in the country’s unpredictable political landscape.\n\n“If my experience of Tunisian politics has taught me anything, it’s to wait and see,” she said. “No one thought Kais Saied could nominate a woman as head of the government. It’s possible [her role could be constricted]: he has an organic conception of power.\n\n“But you can’t predict what’s going to happen. We must wait for the [political] programme, the vision, and also what is proposed in terms of an institutional roadmap. We are in limbo at the moment. We must wait and see.”",

    "content": "The ocean’s “biological pump” describes the many marine processes that work to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and transport it deep into the ocean, where it can remain sequestered for centuries. This ocean pump is a powerful regulator of atmospheric carbon dioxide and an essential ingredient in any global climate forecast.\n\nBut a new MIT study points to a significant uncertainty in the way the biological pump is represented in climate models today. Researchers found that the “gold standard” equation used to calculate the pump’s strength has a larger margin of error than previously thought, and that predictions of how much atmospheric carbon the ocean will pump down to various depths could be off by 10 to 15 parts per million.\n\nGiven that the world is currently emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at an annual rate of about 2.5 parts per million, the team estimates that the new uncertainty translates to about a five-year error in climate target projections.\n\n“This larger error bar might be critical if we want to stay within 1.5 degrees of warming targeted by the Paris Agreement,” says Jonathan Lauderdale, a research scientist in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. “If current models predict we have until 2040 to cut carbon emissions, we’re expanding the uncertainty around that, to say maybe we now have until 2035, which could be quite a big deal.”\n\nLauderdale and former MIT graduate student B.B. Cael, now at the National Oceanography Center in Southampton, U.K., have published their study today in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nSnow curve\n\nThe marine processes that contribute to the ocean’s biological pump begin with phytoplankton, microscopic organisms that soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow. When they die, phytoplankton collectively sink through the water column as “marine snow,” carrying that carbon with them.\n\n“These particles rain down like white flaky snow that is all this dead stuff falling out of the surface ocean,” Lauderdale says.\n\nAt various depths the particles are consumed by microbes, which convert the particles’ organic carbon and respire it into the deep ocean in an inorganic, mineral form, in a process known as remineralization.\n\nIn the 1980s, researchers collected marine snow at locations and depths throughout the tropical Pacific. From these observations they generated a simple power law  mathematical relationship — the Martin curve, named after team member John Martin — to describe the strength of the biological pump, and how much carbon the ocean can remineralize and sequester at various depths.\n\n“The Martin curve is ubiquitous, and it’s really the gold standard [used in many climate models today],” Lauderdale says.\n\nBut in 2018, Cael and co-author Kelsey Bisson showed that the power law derived to explain the Martin curve was not the only equation that could fit the observations. The power law is a simple mathematical relationship that assumes that particles fall faster with depth. But Cael found that several other mathematical relationships, each based on different mechanisms for how marine snow sinks and is remineralized, could also explain the data.\n\nFor instance, one alternative assumes that particles fall at the same rate no matter the depth, while another assumes that particles with heavy, less-consumable phytoplankton shells fall faster than those without.\n\n“He found that you can’t tell which curve is the right one, which is a bit troubling, because each curve has different mechanisms behind it,” Lauderdale says. “In other words, researchers might be using the ‘wrong’ function to predict the strength of the biological pump. These discrepancies could snowball and impact climate projections.”\n\nA curve, reconsidered\n\nIn the new study, Lauderdale and Cael looked at how much difference it would make to estimates of carbon stored deep in the ocean if they changed the mathematical description of the biological pump.\n\nThey started with the same six alternative equations, or remineralization curves, that Cael had previously studied. The team looked at how climate models’ predictions of atmospheric carbon dioxide would change if they were based on any of the six alternatives, versus the Martin curve’s power law.\n\nTo make the comparison as statistically similar as possible, they first fit each alternative equation to the Martin curve. The Martin curve describes the how much marine snow reaches various depths through the ocean. The researchers entered the data points from the curve into each alternative equation. They then ran each equation through the MITgcm, a general circulation model that simulates, among other processes, the flux of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the ocean.\n\nThe team ran the climate model forward in time to see how each alternative equation for the biological pump changed the model’s estimates of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, compared with the Martin curve’s power law. They found that the amount of carbon that the ocean is able to draw down and sequester from the atmosphere varies widely, depending on which mathematical description for the biological pump they used.\n\n“The surprising part was that even small changes in the amount of remineralization or marine snow making it to different depths due to the different curves can lead to significant changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide,” Lauderdale says.\n\nThe results suggest that the ocean’s pumping strength, and the processes that govern how fast marine snow falls, are still an open question.  \n\n“We definitely need to make many more measurements of marine snow to break down the mechanisms behind what’s going on,” Lauderdale adds. “Because probably all these processes are relevant, but we really want to know which are driving carbon sequestration.”\n\nThis research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation, the Simons Collaboration on Computational Biogeochemical Modeling of Marine Ecosystems, and the UK National Environmental Research Council.\n\nSHARE THIS NEWS ARTICLE ON:\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Print\nRELATED LINKS\nJonathan Lauderdale\nDepartment of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences",

Whether the situation stabilizes or worsens depends on this factor,\" Chung said.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in said Monday his government will introduce new social distancing rules next month as South Korea is gearing up for full-fledged COVID-19 vaccine shots.

    "content": "New video and dueling narratives emerged Sunday about an encounter between a Native American leader and a group of Kentucky high-schoolers in Washington that went viral and drew widespread condemnation this weekend.\n\nThe Covington Catholic student at the center of the firestorm issued a statement that claimed he was only trying to defuse a tense and confusing situation when he stood eye-to-eye with tribal elder Nathan Phillips, a smile plastered on his face and a Make America Great Again hat on his head, while schoolmates cheered.\n\n“It was clear to me he had singled me out for a confrontation,” the student, Nicholas Sandmann, wrote in the statement.\n\nPhillips, meanwhile, said he was also trying to calm tensions—between the teens and a cluster of Black Hebrew Israelite protesters—when he approached the group while singing and drumming. He said he saw “hatred” in the eyes of the “beastly young men.”\n\nVideo posted Friday of the Lincoln Memorial face-off between the students, who were attending the March for Life, and Phillips, who was part of the Indigenous Peoples March, sparked outrage. Phillips, a Vietnam veteran, told reporters the teens had a “mob mentality” that he found “scary,” and the school and diocese apologized and promised an investigation.\n\nThe initial clip of the encounter shows Phillips surrounded by the Covington students, who are hyperactively chanting and dancing. One student, one of the many sporting MAGA apparel, stands directly in front of Phillips and smiles widely at him for nearly two minutes while he drums.\nBut a second video circulated Sunday shows the lead-up to the encounter and appears to offer a more complete picture of what happened.\n\nIn those minutes, a small group of Black Israelite protesters is shown hurling insults at the students as they are standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. At one point, they can be heard calling the teenagers “incest babies.”\n\nThat video was made by one of the protesters, and it’s not clear what, if anything, the students said in response, or what sparked the confrontation.\n\nSoon after, the teens began chanting pep rally songs—and one student went as far as to run down the stairs into the space between the two groups and rip off his shirt and sweatshirt.\n\nSoon after, Phillips can be seen walking between the groups and drumming as they continued to shout at each other.\n\n“I was scared and I didn’t want to. I really, I really didn’t want to, but nobody else was,” Phillips later told Indian Country Today. “We’re indigenous. We’re different than that. When we see our youth going the wrong way, we will go up and say, ‘You are doing the wrong thing there nephew, or grandson. This is just the wrong way.’ I tell them, ‘This is the way you have to behave. This wrong, this is right,'” he said.\n\nVideo shows Phillips drumming and singing what Rolling Stone identified as “Raymond Yellow Thunder Song.” The Black Hebrew Israelite protesters appeared to support Phillips, calling him their “elder” and claiming he was there to protect them as he approached the Covington Catholic students and made his way into the crowd, ultimately standing face-to-face with them as they surrounded him.\n\nThe Covington Catholic students have since come forward with their side of the story, claiming that they were victims of a “publicity stunt” and that portrayal of the confrontation by some media outlets is “not true and taken entirely out of context.”Response from Cov Cath student who says he was present at the event in question in Washington.@Local12 pic.twitter.com/nqLD1pJY2u\n\n— Adam Clements (@AClementsWKRC) January 20, 2019\nOne student wrote to Cincinnati's Local 12 news to explain that while the students were milling about on the Lincoln Memorial steps awaiting their bus home, “we decided to do some cheers to pass time.”\n\n“In the midst of our cheers, we were approached by a group of adults led by Nathan Phillips, with Phillips beating his drum. They forced their way into the center of our group,” the student claimed. “We initially thought this was a cultural display since he was beating along to our cheers and so we clapped to the beat. He came to stand in front of one of my classmates who stood where he was, smiling and enjoying the experience.\n\n“However, after multiple minutes of Mr. Phillips beating his drum directly in the face of my friend (mere centimeters from his nose), we became confused and started wondering what was happening. It was not until later that we discovered they would incriminate us as a publicity stunt.”\n\n“As a result,” he added, “my friend faces expulsion for for simply standing still and our entire school is being disparaged for a crime we did not commit.”\n\nSandmann, in the statement later tweeted by CNN’s Jake Tapper, said he and his peers were responding to the Hebrew Israelite protesters.\n\n“Because we were being loudly attacked and taunted in public, a student in our group asked one of our teacher chaperones for permission to begin our school spirit chants to counter the hateful things that were being shouted at our group,” Sandmann said.\n\nWhen Phillips came to intervene, Sandmann said, “he locked eyes with me and approached me, coming within inches of my face. He played his drum the entire time he was in my face.”\nJust in: Statement of Nick Sandmann, Covington Catholic High School junior, about the event at the Lincoln Memorial: pic.twitter.com/PkuMh2cVZM\n\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 20, 2019\nSandmann further claimed that “I believed that by remaining motionless and calm, I was helping to diffuse [sic] the situation,” and that “I did smile at one point because I wanted him to know that I was not going to become angry, intimidated, or provoked into a larger confrontation.”  \n\nPhillips, however, tells a different story. “There was that moment when I realized I’ve put myself between beast and prey,” he told The Detroit Free Press. While he said he’d seen one of the Hebrew Israelite protesters spit in the direction of the students, he said it was “scary” to see “hatred” in the teenagers’ eyes during the encounter. “These young men were beastly and these old black individuals was their prey, and I stood in between them and so they needed their pounds of flesh and they were looking at me for that.”",

    "content": "Africans are more tolerant of differences in ethnicity, religion and nationality than many familiar narratives would indicate, yet nearly eight out of ten do not want LGBT neighbors, according to a new report from Afrobarometer, a public opinion research organization set up by Africanist scholars.\n\nThe report was released to coincide with the United Nations’ Zero Discrimination Day on March 1st, and it has been designed to add much needed data points to ongoing discussions of ethnicity, religion, and immigration in African contexts, as well as the rights of the LGBT community and people living with HIV.\n\nAfrica is often discussed in terms of conflict driven by ethnic and religious differences. However, in a continent that Afrobarometer says “has become synonymous” with conflict driven by differences, the organization found after the completion of 50,000 interviews across 33 African countries that nine out of ten respondents said they would welcome or accept neighbors with a different ethnic background to themselves. Furthermore, 87% of Africans exhibited tolerance for those from a different religion.GENERALLY NICE NEIGHBORS…\nA particularly important finding is that even though “sizable minorities express rejection of immigrants: Lesotho (42%), Zambia (35%), Mauritius (34%), Madagascar (33%), Morocco (33%), and South Africa (32%),” the research team found that “overall, 81% of Africans say they would like or not mind having neighbors” who are from somewhere else. Afrobarometer says that these results position Africans as “among the most migrant- tolerant people in the world.”\n\nThe report’s co-author, Dr. Kim Yi Dionne, a specialist on African politics at Smith College, emphasized that Afrobarometer’s findings are encouraging, as “you have this overwhelming majority of people who say they would be willing to have neighbors who are from other groups.”\n\nIn a conversation with the BBC, Dr. Dionne added that part of the motivation for building a large data set on tolerance comes from the idea that “there is a strong disconnect between lived realities in Africa and the way things are reported on in the media or even studied among academics.” She said, “I think that the findings from our research are quite contrary to the conventional narrative of Africa as a place of division – whether inter-ethnic, or inter-religious, or xenophobic, or even homophobic.”\n\n…BUT LESS SO IF THE NEIGHBOR IS GAY\nAfrobarometer says that intolerance towards LGBT people is still significant, yet the data makes the degree of variation between countries visible. Although the majority of respondents in Cape Verde, South Africa, Namibia and Mozambique expressed tolerance for LGBT people, acceptance dropped to 11% in Ghana, and in Senegal, only 3% of respondents said they would not object to the presence of an LGBT neighbor.\n\nThe Afrobarometer team even decided against investigating levels of tolerance towards LGBT people in Sudan, Egypt and Algeria because they saw the subject as “too sensitive” to be included in interviews. The report indicates that “it is only on the question of homosexuality that a majority (78%) of Africans exhibit deeply intolerant attitudes,” with four out of five respondents rejecting the idea of having an LGBT neighbor.Even with tolerance of LGBT people being reported at an alarmingly low 21% and mixed levels of acceptance for people with HIV at 68%, there are reasons for optimism moving forward.  The report’s findings showed that “younger citizens are more tolerant than their elders,” and that media exposure, access to education and proximity to different groups were all drivers of increased tolerance.\n\nDr. Dionne pointed out that, “We do see the media as a potential source for further increasing tolerance in the future – and I think this is important as we talk about some of those groups that didn’t quite generate the same attitudes of tolerance in the 33 countries that we studied.”\n\nPerhaps the most encouraging element of Afrobarometer’s work is that it suggests public opinion around difference and identity is changeable. Overall, the report emphasizes that it is possible to shift attitudes to become more accepting of difference over time – an essential project in any country.",

    "content": "First steps to a safer future: the Convention in summary\nThe Convention:\n\nRecognized that there was a problem.\nThis was remarkable for its time. Remember, in 1994, when the UNFCCC took effect, there was less scientific evidence than there is now. The UNFCCC borrowed a very important line from one of the most successful multilateral environmental treaties in history (the Montreal Protocol, in 1987): it bound member states to act in the interests of human safety even in the face of scientific uncertainty.\n\nRelated reading: Science\n\nSets a lofty but specific goal.\nThe ultimate objective of the Convention is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations \"at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human induced) interference with the climate system.\" It states that \"such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.\"\n\nHow do we know what is \"dangerous anthropogenic interference\"? See IPCC's Reports\n\nPuts the onus on developed countries to lead the way.\nThe idea is that, as they are the source of most past and current greenhouse gas emissions, industrialized countries are expected to do the most to cut emissions on home ground. They are called Annex I countries and belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). They include 12 countries with \"economies in transition\" from Central and Eastern Europe. Annex I countries were expected by the year 2000 to reduce emissions to 1990 levels. Many of them have taken strong action to do so, and some have already succeeded.\n\nWhat compelled these countries to act? See The Kyoto Protocol\n\nDirects new funds to climate change activities in developing countries.\nIndustrialized nations agree under the Convention to support climate change activities in developing countries by providing financial support for action on climate change-- above and beyond any financial assistance they already provide to these countries. A system of grants and loans has been set up through the Convention and is managed by the Global Environment Facility. Industrialized countries also agree to share technology with less-advanced nations.\n\nRelated reading: Climate Finance, Climate Technology, Capacity-Building\n\nKeeps tabs on the problem and what's being done about it.\nIndustrialized countries (Annex I) have to report regularly on their climate change policies and measures, including issues governed by the Kyoto Protocol (for countries which have ratified it).\nThey must also submit an annual inventory of their greenhouse gas emissions, including data for their base year (1990)and all the years since.\nDeveloping countries (Non-Annex I Parties) report in more general terms on their actions both to address climate change and to adapt to its impacts - but less regularly than Annex I Parties do, and their reporting is contingent on their getting funding for the preparation of the reports, particularly in the case of the Least Developed Countries.\nFind out more about the reporting process here.:What is transparency and reporting\n\nCharts the beginnings of a path to strike a delicate balance.\nEconomic development is particularly vital to the world's poorer countries. Such progress is difficult to achieve even without the complications added by climate change. The Convention takes this into consideration by accepting that the share of greenhouse gas emissions produced by developing nations will grow in the coming years. Nonetheless, in the interests of fulfilling its ultimate goal, it seeks to help such countries limit emissions in ways that will not hinder their economic progress. One such win-win solution was to emerge later, when the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention was conceived.\n\nRelated reading: the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol\n\nKicks off formal consideration of adaptation to climate change.\nThe Convention acknowledges the vulnerability of all countries to the effects of climate change and calls for special efforts to ease the consequences, especially in developing countries which lack the resources to do so on their own. In the early years of the Convention, adaptation received less attention than mitigation, as Parties wanted more certainty on impacts of and vulnerability to climate change. When IPCC's Third Assessment Report was released, adaptation gained traction, and Parties agreed on a process to address adverse effects and to establish funding arrangements for adaptation. Currently, work on adaptation takes place under different Convention bodies. The Adaptation Committee, which Parties agreed to set up under the Cancun Adaptation Framework as part of the Cancun Agreements, is a major step towards a cohesive, Convention-based approach to adaptation.\n\nRelated reading: Adaptation\n\nUNFCCC and the Rio Convention\nThe UNFCCC is a “Rio Convention”, one of two opened for signature at the “Rio Earth Summit” in 1992. Its sister Rio Conventions are the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. The three are intrinsically linked. It is in this context that the Joint Liaison Group was set up to boost cooperation among the three Conventions, with the ultimate aim of developing synergies in their activities on issues of mutual concern.",

He heads the project CoronaDX, in which researchers develop three new measuring instruments capable of performing fast on-site diagnosis of coronavirus.\n\nProject partner, Professor and Chief of Virus R&D Anders Fomsgaard from Statens Seruminstitut (SSI) also continues on working because two out of the three instruments are scheduled to be ready for emergency use in October, when the next wave of COVID-19 is expected to hit Denmark. The third instrument is scheduled to be ready in March 2021.Several research teams are working on a vaccine, but it will be 1-2 years at best before it is approved for use. In the meantime, it is essential to develop technology able to quickly separate healthy people from infected people, thereby delaying the spread of the virus as much as possible.\n\nTaking the pressure off hospitals\n\nThe fastest instrument will give the diagnosis in less than one minute. The slowest in less than an hour. All three instruments are being designed to be very easy to use – much like a pregnancy test. They can, therefore, be used in clinics or at home and provide an immediate diagnosis. This enables on-site testing, which saves both time and resources related to transportation and analysis, thereby decreasing the pressure on the central test laboratories. The risk of hospital staff being infected is also reduced, as the infected can be quarantined immediately.\n\nQuarantine-affected persons will also be able to get an immediate diagnosis. If they are not infected, they can then resume their normal lives and work right away. That means more working people to keep the country running as normally as possible during an epidemic.Professor Anders Fomsgaard from Statens Serum Institut is responsible for the development of two of the instruments, including the fastest one that gives the result in less than one minute. He is certain that the speed and ease of use of the new instruments could increase the effectiveness of the healthcare system’s response to any future epidemics:\n\n“A quick simple test easy to perform and without significant costs to the person, can become a new tool for diagnosing disease, infection potential and prompt recovery notification. The technique can be used in a wide range of other viral diseases in patients who are best diagnosed outside of hospitals. ”\n\n” In October, we expect to have a permit for emergency use in Denmark and thus be ready for the possible second wave of coronavirus.”\n\nRapid development\n\nUnder normal conditions, such a development would take several years, and Professor Anders Wolff from DTU Bioengineering, who heads the project, says that this project is developing unusually fast:\n\n“It’s quite clear that the research community is acutely aware that this is a very special and serious situation, and we work together as colleagues across countries and organizations rather than as competitors. That is why there are so many publicly available RNA sequences for COVID-19, and that is one of the reasons we are able to work as fast as we currently do.”\n\nThe three new instruments measure in three different ways in order to recognize the virus, and the technology itself is the absolutely newest in the field. The researches themselves have very recently developed it in another EU funded project aimed at detecting diseases in poultry. Ander Wolff elaborates:\n\n“The measuring instrument itself is ready. What we need to do now is to develop new reagents—that is, the substance that must react with the virus and thus show whether a person is infected. The epidemic is so serious that our research is covered by emergency regulations, which is why we are allowed to test our equipment in the field at a much earlier stage than usual. As early as June, our two Chinese partners will test two of the instruments in the field in China. In October, we expect to have a permit for emergency use in Denmark and thus be ready for the possible second wave of coronavirus.”",

    "content": "Multiple people were killed in a major crash involving a tour bus on its way to Ohio from New Jersey and three semi-trucks on the Pennsylvania Turnpike early Sunday in the western part of the state that left dozens injured, according to officials.\n\nThe \"extremely serious\" crash happened around 3:40 a.m. Sunday in the highway's westbound lanes in Mount Pleasant Township, located about 40 miles southeast of downtown Pittsburgh, according to Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Stephen Limani.\n\nLimani said there were five fatalities and about 60 injuries as a result of the crash. Of those injured -- ranging in age from 7 to \"into their 60's\" -- two are listed in critical condition, according to Limani.\n\nNJ TRANSIT TRAIN SLAMS INTO CAR ON TRACKS SOUTHWEST OF NEWARK, KILLING DRIVER AND PASSENGER\n\nPennsylvania State Police said the tour bus was traveling westbound on the highway from Rockaway, New Jersey to Cincinnati on a downhill curve when it struck an embankment and rolled over. After the bus rolled over, it was then struck by two semi-trucks before a third truck collided with the two other semis involved in the initial crash. Another vehicle then also became ensnared in the crash site.\n\nA total of six vehicles were involved in the crash, including a tour bus, three semi-trucks loaded with parcels and one private passenger vehicle, according to police.State police said that a total of 39 people were transported to area hospitals, including 28 sent to Frick Hospital in Mount Pleasant and 11 transported to Forbes Hospital in Monroeville.\n\nImages from the scene showed mangled wreckage on the highway. A tour bus could be seen flipped on its side as a result of the crash.Angela Maynard, a tractor-trailer driver from Kentucky, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review she was traveling eastbound with her co-driver on the turnpike around 3:30 a.m. when they came across the crash.\n\n“It was horrible,” she said.\n\nMaynard told the newspaper she saw someone on the ground, while another person was trapped in their truck.\n\nSUV DRIVES OFF CALIFORNIA CLIFF – BUT NEITHER VEHICLE NOR OCCUPANTS HAS BEEN FOUND, AUTHORITIES SAY\n\n“I walked toward the scene and saw one of the truck drivers laying [sic] near the barrier. I tried to keep him occupied, keep talking, until medical help arrived,\" Maynard told the Tribune-Review. \"He was in bad shape. He was floating in and out of consciousness.”\n\nThe bus, part of Z&D Tours, was filled with passengers mostly from other countries, according to Limani. He said two \"most prominent\" languages were Japanese or Spanish, but officials are still working on identifying those who were killed or injured due to many having documents and identification that are still at the crash scene.\n\n\"It's just a lot going on when it comes to identifying them and contacting their loved ones,\" he told reporters at a news conference Sunday afternoon.Limani said the Red Cross is assisting the victims of the crash, and \"doing everything\" to make it as comfortable as it can be to those impacted by the incident.\n\nThe crash caused all lanes to be closed in both directions on the highway between the Breezewood and New Stanton exits, roughly an 86-mile stretch of roadway.\n\nMotorists traveling east are being urged to use Route 119 south US 40 east to Interstate 68 east (at Cumberland, Maryland) to Interstate 70 west and re-enter the turnpike at the Breezewood Interchange exit 161.Westbound motorists are urged to use Route 30 west to Interstate 99 north to US Route 22 west to Route 66 south and re-enter the turnpike at exit 75 in at the New Stanton exit, according to KDKA-TV.It was not clear if the weather was a factor in the crash. The National Weather Service forecast for Westmoreland County early Sunday listed light unknown precipitation and an air temperature just below freezing.\n\n\"The one thing about traveling through Pennsylvania is that we have change in weather. It could be just because of our mountains, our hills. Just the way that our elevation changes,\" Limani told reporters. \"We were told that by some of the people that were driving, that the weather did start to change.\"\n\nLimani told reporters that weather conditions \"could have played a factor\" in the crash, but authorities will be able to \"get to that answer\" as the investigation progresses.\n\nPennsylvania Turnpike Chief Operating Officer Craig Shuey told reporters at a news conference Sunday afternoon that work crews had been treating the roadway since 9 p.m. due to wintry conditions in the region. Shey added that road crews were cycling treatment using either salt or cinders during the time period before the crash took place.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has dispatched a board member and team of 13 people to the scene, according to Limani\n\nOne FedEx semi-truck was pictured among the trucks involved in the crash. In a statement to Fox News, a FedEx spokesperson said the company extends \"our deepest condolences to the families of the individuals involved in this accident.\"\n\n\"There is no higher priority for FedEx Ground than safety, and we are cooperating fully with investigating authorities at this time,\" the spokesperson added.",

It marks the ten-day worship of the Hindu mother-goddess Durga. In the months preceding the festival, small artisanal workshops sculpt images of Durga and her family using unfired clay pulled from the Ganga River. The worship of the goddess then begins on the inaugural day of Mahalaya, when eyes are painted onto the clay images to bring the goddess to life. It ends on the tenth day, when the images are immersed in the river from where the clay came. Thus, the festival has also come to signify ‘home-coming’ or a seasonal return to one’s roots. Durga Puja is seen as the best instance of the public performance of religion and art, and as a thriving ground for collaborative artists and designers. The festival is characterized by large-scale installations and pavilions in urban areas, as well as by traditional Bengali drumming and veneration of the goddess. During the event, the divides of class, religion and ethnicities collapse as crowds of spectators walk around to admire the installations.",

    "content": "In a global pandemic that has devastated most of the film industry and the movie theater business, there is still room for the occasional Hollywood ending.\n\nThe economic toll from Covid-19 has been dramatic: Just under half of the movie theaters across North America are closed, and strict social distancing guidelines restrict the seats available in the ones that are open. Theater owners haven't been helped by having few new films to show on their screens. Studios have been forced to push back the releases of their highest-profile movies to next year or skip theatrical releases entirely, punting some movies straight to streaming services, leading to a box office 77.2 percent worse than at this time last year, according to the media analytics company Comscore.\n\nThat has left an opening for enterprising independent filmmakers and distributors to find their own paths to the big screen and to success via brick-and-mortar theaters, drive-ins or virtual cinemas.\n\nAnd it's working for some of them.\n\nProducer/distributor Manny Halley is banking that his latest crime thriller, \"True to the Game 2,\" which opened in theaters nationwide last Friday, can help fill the void left by the studios that abandoned multiplexes this fall.\n\n\"It's created a lane for independent filmmakers to be able to come out, because a lot of the big studios normally take all the theaters,\" Halley said.\n\nHalley said independent distributors like him can thrive under those conditions because their production and marketing costs are so much lower than those of the big studios.\n\n\"I'm just trying to give our culture what they need,\" said Halley, who is targeting a predominantly urban, Black audience for his tale of a journalist targeted by the criminal who killed her fiancé.\n\n\"We're in Black Lives Matter. We focus on the culture, our culture, right now. The demographic of this movie is ages from 18 to 42, so I think we're going to hit our mark,\" he said.On a weekend that was supposed to have been dominated by Marvel's \"Black Widow\" — before Disney shunted the superhero film from theatrical release back to coming attractions — Halley's sequel to the 2017 film \"True to the Game\" earned an average of $1,234 on 247 screens, the second best box office average of the three-day span.\n\nFinishing in first place at the box office last weekend, with $4 million, was the Kevin Costner thriller \"Let Him Go\" — the type of movie that might have gone straight to video on demand in a different year.\n\nThere is apparently still some appetite left for popcorn.\n\n\"The pandemic has changed the types of movies that are being released, because the bigger movies either moved to streaming or moved to next year, waiting for theaters to open up,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior box office analyst for Comscore.\n\nThe only studio tentpole released during the Covid-19 era was Warner Bros.' \"Tenet,\" with the industry hoping that a Christopher Nolan-directed action film would bring in moviegoers despite concerns about sitting in an indoor theater for more than two hours. But its $54.3 million domestic haul since Labor Day weekend was far below what a film of that scale would be expected to make in North America if there weren't a deadly pathogen going around.\n\nA much smaller entry, the Russell Crowe vehicle \"Unhinged,\" may well be the biggest success, earning $19.6 million over its domestic run, solid numbers considering the scale of production and marketing costs.\n\nNext year,however, major studios will have an onslaught of films to release, including the big anticipated hits delayed from 2020, starting with \"Wonder Woman 1984,\" now scheduled as a Christmas Day present for beleaguered theaters. The next \"Black Widow,\" \"Fast & Furious 9,\" \"Dune\" and the next James Bond installment, \"No Time to Die,\" are among the films now due out in 2021. There won't be a lot of screens left to go around once that happens, especially as the National Association of Theatre Owners warned Congress in September that 69 percent of small and midsize movie theater companies will be forced to close or file for bankruptcy without federal relief.\"This may be a window of opportunity that doesn't come around again for independent films,\" Dergarabedian said.\n\nIn the meantime, art house cinema has been forced into a rewrite of its own, as most of the theaters that curate those critically acclaimed films have remained closed.\n\nSeveral independent distributors have used a hybrid model, opting for limited runs in drive-in theaters while screening those films through \"virtual cinemas.\" Independent mainstays, such as Kino Lorber, Magnolia and Oscilloscope, have put their films online while giving a cut to theaters in exchange for help publicizing the releases with their loyal patrons, said Ira Deutchman, a longtime independent film producer, distributor and marketer.\n\n\"Those people count on a certain level of taste and have become really loyal supporters,\" said Deutchman, who teaches in the film program at Columbia University. \"And even in this Covid age when they can't sell tickets, the not-for-profit art houses are doing really well in terms of donor support.\n\n\"The fact [is] that they quickly opened up these virtual cinema sites, where it may not be a huge amount of income, but they do have some income to survive,\" he said.\n\nDrive-ins have also made a resurgence in the past few months, in large part because of the ease of social distancing inside vehicles compared to indoor auditoriums.\n\nThat wasn't the road producer Tricia Grashaw and her creative partner, writer/director Todd Theman, had originally planned to take after toiling for eight years to make their film, \"Little Black Lie.\" The drama — about a woman who lies to her fiancé about being raped to hide an affair, setting in motion a dark chain of events as a consequence — had been intended to debut in a rented theater in the spring.\n\nThen California locked down in March.\n\n\"This year was our time to kind of finish up on the festival circuit and try to get out there to distributors,\" Grashaw said. \"Then Covid happened. So it kind of changed our plans a little bit.\"At first, Grashaw eyed streaming services, but she said it would be impossible to compete for attention on Amazon or Netflix because of all the bigger films that were opting for that route. So they opted for a less modern approach.\n\nThe budding filmmakers are now getting their chance to see their labor of love projected on a 50-foot inflatable screen at a pop-up theater, the New Van Nuys Drive-In near Los Angeles, on Friday night.\n\nDrive-ins have been thriving despite having few original movies to showcase. From May 1 through Labor Day, the traditional summer season for the movie biz, drive-ins accounted for $101.1 million of the industry's $175 million total ticket sales, according to Comscore.\n\n\"Independent filmmakers have the drive to just continue to push forward and not be discouraged by what life throws at you, because that's always been the case for us,\" Grashaw said.\n\n\"We've always taken every setback and tried to find a way to make it work, no matter what. So this is just another one of those things where it's like 'OK, well, theaters are closed, so we're going to do this now. We're going to make the best of it.'",

    "content": "Earlier this month California Gov. Gavin Newsom, looking uncharacteristically wan and frustrated, stood in the burnt ruins of an elementary school in Napa County obliterated by yet another catastrophic blaze.\n\nIt's a scene the governor acknowledged has become painfully familiar across the Golden State.\n\n\"Regions that have been torn asunder by wildfires seemingly every single year, this drum beat where people are exhausted, concerned, anxious about their fate and their future not just their safety,\" Newsom said, adding with a hint of exhaustion, \"so clearly we have our work cut out for us to deal with not only suppression, but prevention strategies.\"\n\nTop of the prevention strategy list for fire ecologists is more fire. This historically destructive wildfire season across much of the Western U.S. has wildfire experts calling for a dramatic increase in the numbers of acres intentionally burned. (That's when trained staff deliberately set fires as a form of control.) They also want significant new investment in workforce training and infrastructure to scale up prescribed burns on public and private lands.Vastly increasing the number of these low-intensity, carefully managed fires is key. Experts say it reduces dangerous levels of highly combustible fuel and underbrush built up over more than a century of trying to snuff out most every forest fire. The conditions set by that longstanding federal and state policy are now worsened by climate change, with fires growing larger, more frequent and more destructive.\n\n\"Some people might say that they're scared of doing prescribed fire. But you know, I'm scared what will happen in the next 10 years if we don't get prescribed fire,\" says fire ecologist and professor Kate Wilkin with the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center at San Jose State University.'Use more fire to fix region's wildfire problem'\n\nIn Colorado, three of the state's five largest wildfires have burned this year, including the still-burning East Troublesome and Cameron Peak blazes. In California, five of biggest on record have occurred just since August.\n\nWilkin recognizes how awful it's been for many in recent years: people who've lost loved ones, homes, businesses and entire communities damaged or destroyed. There's the fear, stress and the smoke-filled air drifting hundreds of miles. So she knows most people in the West right now might not want to hear it, but the West needs to strategically use more fire to fix the region's wildfire problem.\n\nIn terms of forest health, Wilkin says, California is supposed to burn. So when the state topped 4 million acres burned earlier this month, setting a record, Wilkin thought, \"Wow, we're actually getting into the ballpark of how many acres used to burn in California every year. Historically, somewhere between 4.4 million and 12 million acres used to burn every year.\"\n\nBy contrast, in the past few years California intentionally burned roughly 50 thousand acres on public lands. In fact, a study published in the journal Fire showed that prescribed burns on federal lands in the West over the past 20 years stayed flat or fell despite ongoing calls to do much more.'Losing this battle every year'\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was the only federal agency to substantially increase prescribed fire use, the study said, likely due to tribal self-governance and a historic embrace of intentional fire.\n\nFederal and California officials recently signed an agreement to try boost that significantly: the new goal is to treat about 1 million acres a year with combined thinning and controlled burns.\n\nBut experts warn that states continue to set ambitious prescribed fire goals they never reach. And critics say that new goal is nowhere near enough to meet this moment.\n\n\"It's not something in which incremental, cautious decisions are going to solve the problem,\" says Malcolm North, an outspoken research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who has long advocated for more controlled burns. \"We have some of the best firefighting forces in the in the world. And yet we're obviously losing this battle every year, both in terms of cost, acreage and damages.\"\n\nNorth says the public has to realize that they're going to get fire one way or another. \"But you can have much better outcomes when you're proactively putting the fire on the landscape rather than reactively trying to suppress it and then dealing with the inevitable escapes,\" he says\n\nHe and others say a major obstacle to expanding controlled burns is institutional inertia in these large, risk-averse state and federal agencies. Critics say both Cal Fire and the U.S. Forest Service largely continue to embrace an antiquated 'fight every fire' ethos.\n\nLeaders in federal land management positions, North says, need to be much more supportive and bold in their use of targeted use of prescribed fire. There needs to be a cultural shift in the public's understanding about both the inevitability of fire, he says, and a shift within the leadership of these agencies.\n\n\"The people who end up getting promoted and often end up in the leadership positions are very good at being cautious,\" North says of his own employer the U.S. Forest Service. \"You really need a pretty fundamental and aggressive change to what we're doing. And that's not inherently the behavior that you often get in leadership in these in these positions.\"\n\nStill, North recognizes the enormous challenge for managers: it's not popular or easy to intentionally light fires to clear out built-up fuel when states are being ravaged and citizens reeling from annual catastrophic wildfires.\n\nIf historically flawed forest management is half the problem here – battling most every fire - the other half is the world's warming climate with hotter, drier conditions igniting a Century of built-up fuel.\n\n\"It's a great example of climate change as a kind of an accelerant,\" says Michael Wara with Stanford's Woods Institute for the Environment. \"This is a problem that's been building gradually for decades. But what is happening this decade is the problem has kind of turned from this thing that we can manage to a monster.\"\n\n'Problem too big for states to solve on their own'\n\nAnd taming that monster through intentional fire, Wara says, is vital yet costly: It's estimated that thinning and prescribed burns can cost somewhere between $1,500 and $2,000 per acre.\n\nThe problem is simply too big for states to solve on their own, especially since the federal government owns the vast majority of public lands in the West, not the states.\n\n\"Coming up with the money to do this at scale has always been a major obstacle,\" Wara says. \"We need sustained federal and state financial support if we're going to have any hope of moving the needle and bring good fire back into the landscape in a way that will be big enough to actually make a difference.\"\n\nAnother challenge too big to solve alone is the lack of a trained workforce to prep and conduct more controlled fires. Fire suppression crews remain stretched incredibly thin across much of the West. And putting out fires and setting controlled blazes \"really are two different skill sets,\" says University of California, Berkeley Fire Science professor Scott Stephens who has long documented the positive impact of fire on the forest eco-system. \"So it really does require us to develop that workforce.\"\n\nStephens and other experts in fire ecology want the region to train up an entirely new force, like the one the southern U.S. already has.\n\n\"There are so many people in the South that are certified prescribed fire burn bosses and practitioners, and they don't work in fire suppression at all,\" he says adding, \"we just don't have that out here.\"\n\nDespite the long, bitter fights in Washington, D.C., over how to manage the nation's forests there are currently several bills in the U.S. Senate that would significantly boost federal funding for intentional fires. One of them even has a little bipartisan support. And two of the bills call for the creation of a Western U.S. prescribed fire training center to build that much-needed workforce to learn to prep and set fires, not just put them out.\n\nOther big barriers to doing more intentional burns include tough environmental rules and strong liability laws that can slow the pace and scale of set blazes. For example, some intentional burns have taken years to plan and implement.\n\nThen there's safety. The vast majority of these fires are done without harm to people or property. But not all. A 2012 prescribed fire in Colorado killed three people and damaged or destroyed more than two dozen homes.\n\nAnother example is a notorious U.S. National Park Service controlled burn 20 years ago near Los Alamos, New Mexico that got out of control when high winds picked up.\n\nSome 400 family homes were burned. The federal nuclear lab there was threatened, with a few of its buildings damaged. Withering criticism and congressional hearings followed.\n\n\"The plan was flawed, the higher ups rubber stamped it, the burn boss was not qualified to do a fire this big,\" then-Congresswoman Heather Wilson, a Republican, told a house hearing on the burn shortly after the fire.\n\nThat Los Alamos fire kind of became the Enron or Solyndra of controlled burns: a rare but spectacularly botched event that ends up having out-sized influence and ripple effects. Twenty years on, the Los Alamos debacle is still felt today across federal land agencies.\n\nIt's a ghost that needs to be exorcised, ecologists say, because controlled burns are largely safe.\n\n\"The perception there is definitely far different than the reality, which is that the fires generally have been able to be controlled,\" says the Forest Service's Malcolm North.\n\nFor fire-ravaged communities the hard truth is that these shifts to increase controlled blazes and reduce catastrophic fire risk will take years, if not decades, of sustained effort.\n\n\"So that's the real problem because, you know, it isn't something that you can invest in wholeheartedly, say, in three years and guarantee yourself a result,\" says UC Berkeley's Stephens. \"It would take a 10-year effort, but probably even closer to 20 to really start to change kind of the fundamentals\" of wildfire risk.",

US media say his symptoms include a low-grade fever.\n\nHe has so far been treated with an experimental drug cocktail injection and the antiviral medication remdesivir after both he and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nIn exactly one month, Mr Trump faces Joe Biden in the presidential election.\n\nThe president's diagnosis has upended his campaign and also cast doubt on his attempt to get a new Supreme Court judge confirmed before polling day.The latest update from Mr Trump's physician, Sean Conley, in a memorandum late on Friday, read: \"I am happy to report the president is doing very well.\" He said the president was not in need of supplemental oxygen.\n\nMr Trump was taken to hospital \"out of an abundance of caution\" with \"mild symptoms\" and would be there for the \"next few days\", the White House said.The list of other people to have tested positive around Mr Trump include close aide Hope Hicks - believed to be the first to show symptoms - campaign manager Bill Stepien and former White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway. Republican Senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis have also tested positive.\n\nMr Trump remains in charge. Vice-President Mike Pence, to whom under the constitution the president would transfer power temporarily should he become too ill to carry out his duties, tested negative.How did the president look on Friday?\nWearing a mask and suit, Mr Trump walked out across the White House lawn on Friday at 18:15 (22:15 GMT) to his helicopter, Marine One, for the short flight to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center close to Washington DC.He waved and gave a thumbs-up to reporters but said nothing before boarding the aircraft.In an 18-second video posted to Twitter, Mr Trump said: \"I think I'm doing very well. But we're going to make sure that things work out. The first lady is doing very well. So thank you very much.\"\n\nThe president's children, Ivanka and Eric, retweeted his post, praising him as a \"warrior\". Ms Trump added: \"I love you dad.\"\n\nDonald Jr said his father was \"obviously taking it very seriously\".\n\nMr Trump was admitted to the presidential suite at Walter Reed, which is where US presidents usually have their annual check-up.\n\nShortly before midnight, he tweeted again: \"Going well, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!\"\n\nUK PM Boris Johnson, who spent time in intensive care with the virus in April, said he had no doubt Mr Trump would make a \"very strong recovery\".\n\nWhat treatment has the president received?\nHis doctor, Sean Conley, said the president was \"not requiring any supplemental oxygen, but in consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate remdesivir therapy. He has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably\".\n\nTests have shown remdesivir, originally developed as an Ebola treatment, disrupts the virus's ability to duplicate and can cut the duration of symptoms.Earlier on Friday, Dr Conley said the president had \"as a precautionary measure received an 8g dose of Regeneron's antibody cocktail\" at the White House.The antibodies stick to the coronavirus, protecting the body's cells and making the virus more visible to the immune system.\n\nHowever, the treatment is still experimental and has not yet been approved by regulators. Although there is a lot of hope behind it, some doctors have expressed surprise at its use on the president at this stage.Mr Trump was also taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin, Dr Conley said.\n\nThe president, being 74, a man and someone categorised as obese, is in a higher-risk category for Covid-19.The first lady, who is 50, was said to be \"well with only a mild cough and headache\".\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Mrs Trump said she was experiencing mild symptoms but was \"feeling good\" and \"looking forward to a speedy recovery\".\n\nThe remainder of the Trump family, including the first couple's son Barron, who also lives at the White House, tested negative.Covid cluster at the heart of government\nAnalysis by Peter Bowes, BBC North America correspondent\n\nThis is a crisis that's escalating by the hour.\n\nWith the news that another member of Trump's inner circle, Kellyanne Conway, has tested positive, along with two Republican senators, there's a growing realisation that a Covid cluster has penetrated the heart of US government.\n\nLike Ms Conway, Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina attended the White House event where the president announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said it would be \"irresponsible and dangerous\" to move forward with Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings.\n\nIt would be another huge blow to the president if the proceedings were delayed, although Senate leader Mitch McConnell has said they will continue with expanded use of remote hearings.How have Democrats reacted?\nMr Biden, the Democratic nominee, and his wife Jill tested negative on Friday. The Bidens wished the presidential couple a speedy recovery.The Democratic campaign is temporarily taking down all its negative ads regarding Mr Trump.\n\nMr Biden, on the campaign trail on Friday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, added: \"It's a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It's not going away automatically.\"Since the onset of the pandemic, Democrats have criticised the president for flouting basic health guidelines - such as social distancing and wearing a facial covering in public - including those promoted by his own administration.\n\nMr Trump has also continued to hold large campaign rallies, gathering thousands of supporters, often without masks.\n\nThe Republican president also poked fun at Mr Biden during their live TV debate on Tuesday, saying: \"I don't wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask.\"\n\nThe most powerful elected Democrat, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said her prayers for Mr Trump had \"intensified\" and she hoped his diagnosis would be \"a learning experience\" for the country.\n\nThe US has had more Covid-19 cases - 7.3 million - and more deaths - 208,000 - than any other nation, according to Johns Hopkins University research.What of others who have tested positive?\nCampaign manager Bill Stepien has \"mild flu-like symptoms\" and Kellyanne Conway also has \"mild symptoms\".\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who was with Mr Trump a week ago, has tested positive, as has Rev John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame University, who visited the White House last weekend for the Supreme Court announcement.\n\nThere has been criticism of the president's decision to go to a fundraiser attended by dozens of people in New Jersey on Thursday, apparently when officials already knew about Hope Hicks' symptoms.\n\nOfficials said the process of tracking all Mr Trump's contacts in recent days was ongoing.\n\nRepublican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin tested positive, without symptoms, on Friday. He had left two weeks of self-quarantine on Tuesday but was exposed to another infected individual shortly after returning to Washington.",

On Thursday, the 42-year-old was one of about 200 people wearing face masks and standing 6 feet apart in the Clark County Government Center’s outdoor amphitheater for the ceremony.\n\n“That night I lost a part of me, and I come back looking for it,” Soto said, with tears in her eyes.\n\nSince October 2017, Soto has moved from California to Minneapolis and has started her dream job as a flight attendant. She said that she decided to “live life to the fullest” for those who died in the attack.\n\nA slideshow during the ceremony displayed the names and pictures of the 58 people killed that night. The pictures of two women who died within the past year of injuries they suffered in the mass shooting were included at the end with a message reading, “In Memoriam of 1 October Victims Lost in the Last Year.”At the end of the ceremony, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced that the two women, Kimberly Gervais of Mira Loma, California, and Samanta Arjune of Las Vegas, will be added to the official death toll, raising the number from 58 to 60.\n\nThe announcement came after the Review-Journal on Monday published an article that highlighted their deaths and reported the Metropolitan Police Department’s initial decision not to include them in the death total.“It isn’t like we’re trying to avoid the names,” Lombardo said in a brief interview after the ceremony. He later added that, “At this point, I think I’m comfortable in acknowledging that the other two individuals lost their lives as a result of 1 October.”\n\nThere were fewer people at the ceremony this year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced officials to limit the number of people who could attend. Gov. Steve Sisolak, who also addressed the crowd, said that when he raised the limit on public gatherings this week, Thursday’s event was one of his “biggest priorities.”Sisolak’s voice grew shaky as he recalled that night and offered his condolences to the family members of those who died.\n\n“We will never, never forget what happened that day, or the lives that were lost, and the lives that were changed,” he said.\n\nAlbert Rivera, the father of Jordyn Rivera, who was 21 when she was killed in the attack, said he was thankful to all the survivors who continue to come together on the anniversary and support each other.\n\n“We are all a statistic — we are all part of this unwanted fraternity we didn’t chose to be a part of,” he said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged Greg Zanis, an Illinois carpenter who built 58 crosses honoring those who died in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Zanis died in May of terminal bladder cancer, and Rivera said he will “be forever changed” by Zanis’ kindness.\n\nHe ended his remarks by calling for unity during what he said has been a time of divisiveness in the U.S. He urged people to remember how they came together on Oct. 2, 2017.\n\n“It’s said that it takes more effort to hate than to love. Let’s remember that,” he said. “Until we meet again — here, there or in the air — may we all smile like Jordyn.”",

    "content": "Remember the vast and mysterious Fermi bubbles, apparent remnants of a titanic explosion close to the supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy? They were widely discussed around the year 2010, noticeable in X-ray and gamma ray data from the ROSAT and Fermi satellites. Astronomers said today (October 6, 2019) that they’ve uncovered more evidence relating the Fermi bubbles – gathered using Hubble Space Telescope data – in the form of two enormous bursts of ionizing radiation that must have zipped through the poles of our galaxy and out into deep space. One burst must have been powerful enough to reach 200,000 light-years into space, so that its impact struck the Magellanic Stream, a long trail of gas extending from the nearby Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, dwarf galaxies orbiting our Milky Way.\n\nAll of this activity from our Milky Way’s center – the explosion and its aftermath – apparently occurred just 3.5 million years ago when, on Earth, the asteroid that triggered the extinction of the dinosaurs was already 63 million years in the past, and humanity’s ancient ancestors, the australopithecines, were roaming in Africa.\n\nThey estimate that the blast lasted for perhaps 300,000 years, a long time in human terms, but an exceedingly short time as measured on the scale of galaxies.The astronomers who recently discovered the flare event – impacting the Magellanic Stream – said they noticed it because:\n\n… some Stream clouds towards both galactic poles are highly ionized by a source capable of producing ionization energies up to at least 50 eV [electronvolts].\n\nAnd these researchers associate this ionization with the blast that created the Fermi bubbles.\n\nThese new findings come from a team of scientists led by astronomer Joss Bland-Hawthorn from Australia’s ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D). They are soon to be published in the peer-reviewed Astrophysical Journal.\n\nAbout 10% of all galaxies are known to have flares of this kind, which are called Seyfert flares. Our galaxy isn’t generally considered a Seyfert galaxy, or a particularly active galaxy at all. But the Milky Way is known to have a 4-million-solar-mass black hole at its heart, called Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star). Even earlier this year, Sgr A* was caught having an unusually large meal of gas and dust.\n\nSo astronomers are learning that the Milky Way, too, can sometimes have a burst of activity, although it’s minor in contrast to true active galaxies.\n\nThe explosion 3.5 million years ago was too huge to have been triggered by anything other than nuclear activity associated with Sgr A*, said the team who studied it. Bland-Hawthorn commented:\n\nThe flare must have been a bit like a lighthouse beam. Imagine darkness, and then someone switches on a lighthouse beacon for a brief period of time.\n\nLisa Kewley, director of ASTRO 3D, said:\n\nThis is a dramatic event that happened a few million years ago in the Milky Way’s history. A massive blast of energy and radiation came right out of the galactic center and into the surrounding material. This shows that the center of the Milky Way is a much more dynamic place than we had previously thought. It is lucky we’re not residing there!Bottom line: Researchers have found evidence of a cataclysmic flare that punched outward in both directions from our galaxy’s center, reaching so far into intergalactic space that its impact was felt 200,000 light-years away. They associate this new discovery with the Fermi bubbles, apparent remnants of a titanic explosion close to the supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy, some 3.5 million years ago.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cybersecurity expert Steven Adair and his team were in the final stages of purging the hackers from a think tank’s network earlier this year when a suspicious pattern in the log data caught their eye.\nThe spies had not only managed to break back in – a common enough occurrence in the world of cyber incident response – but they had sailed straight through to the client’s email system, waltzing past the recently refreshed password protections like they didn’t exist.\n\n“Wow,” Adair recalled thinking in a recent interview. “These guys are smarter than the average bear.”\n\nIt was only last week that Adair’s company - the Reston, Virginia-based Volexity - realized that the bears it had been wrestling with were the same set of advanced hackers who compromised Texas-based software company SolarWinds.\n\nUsing a subverted version of the company’s software as a makeshift skeleton key, the hackers crept into a swathe of U.S. government networks, including the Departments of Treasury, Homeland Security, Commerce, Energy, State and other agencies besides.\n\nWhen news of the hack broke, Adair immediately thought back to the think tank, where his team had traced one of the break-in efforts to a SolarWinds server but never found the evidence they needed to nail the precise entry point or alert the company. Digital indicators published by cybersecurity company FireEye on Dec. 13 confirmed that the think tank and SolarWinds had been hit by the same actor.\n\nSenior U.S. officials and lawmakers have alleged that Russia is to blame for the hacking spree, a charge the Kremlin denies.\n\nAdair – who spent about five years helping defend NASA from hacking threats before eventually founding Volexity – said he had mixed feelings about the episode. On the one hand, he was pleased that his team’s assumption about a SolarWinds connection was right. On the other, they had been at the outer edge of a much bigger story.\n\nA big chunk of the U.S. cybersecurity industry is now in the same place Volexity was earlier this year, trying to discover where the hackers have been and eliminate the various secret access points the hackers likely planted on their victims’ networks. Adair’s colleague Sean Koessel said the company was fielding about 10 calls a day from companies worried that they might have been targeted or concerned that the spies were in their networks.\nHis advice to everyone else hunting for the hackers: “Don’t leave any stone unturned.”\n\nKoessel said the effort to uproot the hackers from the think tank - which he declined to identify - stretched from late 2019 to mid-2020 and occasioned two renewed break-ins. Performing the same task across the U.S. government is likely to be many times more difficult.\n\n“I could easily see it taking half a year or more to figure out - if not into the years for some of these organizations,” Koessel said.\n\nPano Yannakogeorgos, a New York University associate professor who served as the founding dean of the Air Force Cyber College, also predicted an extended timeline and said some networks would have to be ripped out and replaced wholesale.\n\nIn any case, he predicted a big price tag as caffeinated experts were brought in to pore over digital logs for traces of compromise.\n\n“There’s a lot of time, treasury, talent and Mountain Dew that’s involved,” he said.",

Last year the New York Times published an exhaustive investigation, notably including recordings of Russian pilots, that directly incriminated Russia in attacks on hospitals in rebel areas.\n\nHRW’s director, Kenneth Roth, wrote on Twitter: “UN secretary general António Guterres gave an excessively narrow mandate to a board of inquiry into attacks on hospitals in Syria, and the inquiry now produces a mealy-mouthed report, all to avoid offending Russia, the prime offender along with Syria.”\n\nIn July last year the security council issued a rare formal diplomatic petition demanding Guterres open an investigation into airstrikes on medical facilities.\n\nThe move infuriated Moscow, which has repeatedly used international forums – such as its veto as a permanent member of the UN security council – to shield Assad from international action. Since intervening in the Syrian war on the regime’s behalf in 2015, Russia has repeatedly denied that its own aircraft target civilian sites.\n\nGuterres attributed the small number of incidents examined in the new report to the absence of UN personnel on the ground and refusal of permission to visit the sites.\n\nThe commission looked at bombings carried out between April and July 2019 in Idlib and the surrounding countryside. One hospital was deselected for not meeting the investigation’s criteria, and a raid on a refugee camp was likely to have been carried out by an Islamist group, the report said.\n\nThe board of inquiry was established in September and its report was supposed to have been submitted by the end of 2019 but was delayed until March.\n\nWestern countries have been demanding for months that a summary of the report be published. Media reports suggest Russian diplomats pressured Guterres’s office not to release it.\n\nThe Syrian and Russian delegations to the UN did not immediately comment on the findings.",

They also felt that he, like many returning Afghans, was a “carpetbagger.”  Many Afghans feel that those who endured the Russians, civil war, and the U.S.-led invasion are the true Afghans and not the ones who left when times got tough and return to capitalize on the trauma of the war-ravaged country.\n\nHe admits he did want to capitalize on the Afghan situation, and that is to “spread tolerance for men, women, gay and transgendered Afghans.”\n\nAfter provocative posts on Facebook of a play he performed in while in the U.K. wearing makeup and posting his flirtations with an airport customs worker, he was deemed a threat to Islam and relieved of his job.\n\nBorn in Kabul in 1979, the year of the Soviet invasion, his family moved to Germany.  His father, who was a diplomat, was recalled to Kabul, but his mother moved Nemat and his two siblings to southern California in 1984 when Sadat was five-years-old.  He was educated in the US, but like many emigres, he wanted to return to his homeland and try to make a positive change in his war-torn home.\n\nFor a quick refresher on Afghanistan’s history, please review the BBC’s timeline here.\n\nIn a country that has been teetering on the brink of catastrophe for almost four decades, with poverty, violence, corruption, not to mention the destabilizing meddling of Pakistan, India, the US, Iran, Saudi Arabia, UK, and many other players, (see Ahmed Rashid’s New York Review of Books review of Carlotta Gall’s The Wrong Enemy: American in Afghanistan 2001-2014.), why care about one gay man coming out?\n\nSadat believes that until the gender apartheid is addressed, where all men, women, gay and transgendered are treated equally without fear of being jailed or killed,  Afghanistan will continue on its destructive path.\n\n“Gender is the gateway for acceptance for all,” he says.\n\nNot that gender equality will solve the countries ills, but it is one of many key steps that need to be made so that perhaps in a generation, some positive strides can be made.  Once all people are allowed to go to school, work, love freely and thrive in their community, the economic and literal health of a community improves with it.\n\n“Almost 65% of the Afghan population are under 25-years-old and they are hungry for a change.” says Sadat.  “Yes, many want to kill me, but they are older more traditional people.  The young people connect with me and are hungry for a different message.”\n\nHis coming out has changed the national discussion.  When former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, visited Columbia University in 20o7 and announced that there are “No homosexuals in Iran,” many felt the same in Afghanistan.But now that Sadat has changed that.  Afghanistan has homosexuals, and Nemat Sadat is one of many hundreds of thousands.\n\nAlthough he lives in hiding in New York City, Sadat is extremely visible on social media.  There are Facebook pages with hundreds of likes and numerous comments calling for his death, he continues to make provocative daily updates on gender and human rights issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  This week the Mullahs of Afghanistan have issued a fatwa.  Using Google Translator for the Dari text from the American Islam Facebook Page, 4/20/14, it reads as follows:\n\nThis person is permissible to kill in Afghanistan!\n\nDear Shia and Sunni scholars in the field of silence, do not!\n\nHomosexuality in all religions, as it is an act of obscene and inhuman is mentioned by some perverted and Satanists are heavily promoted in Europe and America so far this approach has become a culture.\n\nIt is a blessing Sadat. Professor at the American University in Afghanistan and to promote homosexuality and Lvatt come to Afghanistan.\n\nIt is permissible to kill this person. And anyone who kills a person, not just a sin not work, but the reward of seeing.\n\n“It is out of the bottle.  It cannot be undone, and I will not be silent.  It is the only way to bring about change,” he says.\n\nConnect with Sadat on his Facebook page or on Twitter.",

    "content": "Before it became the site of Sunday’s deadly mass shooting, the Route 91 Harvest festival was one of a handful of concert blowouts aiming to burnish the Las Vegas Strip’s reputation as a live-music destination.\n\nJason Aldean, Eric Church and Sam Hunt were among the major country music stars performing at the sold-out, three-day festival at Las Vegas Village. Last month, the iHeartRadio Music Festival used the same outdoor space for its Daytime Village performances.\n\nThe 15-acre plot near Luxor and Mandalay Bay is one of two open-air venues on the Strip owned by MGM Resorts International.\n\nFor years, owners of the Village and the much larger Las Vegas Festival Grounds have been looking to turn the venues into preeminent destinations for music fans in a city boasting a seemingly unlimited supply of entertainment options.Electric Daisy Carnival may be the king of Vegas festivals — it drew an estimated 400,000 EDM fans this year — but the event, which moved from Los Angeles in 2011, is anchored miles away from the glitz of the tourist-driven Strip.\n\nRoute 91 was one of the events trying to draw music fans closer to the Strip. The Live Nation-promoted concert did so by breaking ground as the first festival in Vegas strictly dedicated to country music.\n\nLaunched in 2014, Route 91 was a success out of the gate and served as an example of what could be pulled off on the Strip. In its inaugural year, when Aldean, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert headlined, the event lured 30,000 fans over three days to a parking lot that had been converted into a festival space. Last year, Route 91 attracted 25,000 guests per day.\n\nAside from the main stage, the festival promoted emerging acts on its Next From Nashville stage. It also featured line dancing and, because it’s Vegas, nightclub-like lounges.\n\nRoute 91’s success stands in contrast to MGM’s attempt to up the festival ante with the massive, multi-genre Rock in Rio USA at the 40-acre Las Vegas Festival Grounds in 2015. Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars and No Doubt headlined the inaugural, two-weekend event.\n\nThe Las Vegas Festival Grounds, like the smaller Las Vegas Village, once housed vehicles: It served as a recreational vehicle campground for Circus Circus before MGM decided to diversify its entertainment offerings.\n\nAnchoring a festival on the Strip came with a number of selling points that executives proudly touted: No port-a-potties, no camping in brutal heat and no snarled traffic in and out of festival grounds considering the tens of thousands of hotel rooms overlooking the Strip.\n\n“This is not Coachella,” Chris Baldizan, senior vice president of entertainment for MGM Resorts International, said ahead of Rock in Rio’s 2015 launch. “People can have their usual Vegas stay … and then walk or take a shuttle to this great music festival and head back to the Strip, which will still be going on.” He added that the festival grounds were “within walking distance of 80,000 hotel rooms.”\n\nEven so, Rock in Rio reported losses of up to $28 million and attendance figures well below the anticipated 328,000.\n\n“Going to a new country, especially one as important as the U.S., we were afraid people might not like it,” festival founder Roberto Medina told The Times during the inaugural weekend.\n\nAfter Rock in Rio USA, the Festival Grounds have been mostly unused — with the exception of the Academy of Country Music’s Party for a Cause Festival in April 2016. Recently, there was chatter that Route 91 would relocate to the larger property.\n\nMGM executives were for it, arguing it would provide more growth, but promoters had a different idea: Stay put and set a manageable capacity of 25,000 guests.\n\n“The ‘look’ of that site … is one of the things that makes Route 91 so great,” Live Nation executive Brian O’Connell told the Las Vegas Review-Journal last year amid rumors of an impending move. “The casino’s bright lights and that real Vegas look. You go north, you lose a little of that, and we don’t want to lose Vegas. That’s why we are here.”\n\nBeing able to manage crowd sizes was crucial to Vegas’ Life Is Beautiful festival, which continues to grow each year.\n\nNow in its fifth year, the festival is spread over 18 blocks in downtown Las Vegas and merges music, food, art and creative expression over three days.\n\nThe festival, which has grown from 17,000 guests per day to 50,000 this year, has been successful at proving it’s not impossible to do big business outside of the many residencies that power Vegas’ entertainment. Last year, Life Is Beautiful was named Pollstar’s 2016 Festival of the Year and Chance the Rapper, Lorde and Muse were among the marquee acts at the September event.\n\nSome have attributed the festival’s rise to organizers staying focused on its fundamental purpose — and not looking to expand its reach outside of the city.\n\n“We made the decision to keep the fabric of it being an intimate, low-key festival experience,” Justin Weniger, one of two organizers behind Life is Beautiful, said ahead of September’s event.\n\n“I grew up on Bonaroo and Coachella and these amazing festivals, but it gets harder to go out to a field or a desert,” Weniger continued. “We wanted it to be relatively easy for people to get a flight and a less expensive hotel than other cities for festivals.”\n\nAhead of last weekend’s Route 91, MGM was hard at work planning on other uses for its larger festival grounds as executives hadn’t yet given up on making both of its open-air venues a larger part of its entertainment portfolio.\n\n“Entertainment is a huge component of our company,” Baldizan said this past summer. “The biggest thing we learned is we have to be in it or not. We’re going to dedicate a bit more of our resources to make festivals a bigger part of our experience.”\n\nCertainly many of those resources will be spent on beefed-up security. Whether that will be enough to ease music fans concerns is impossible to know in the immediate wake of Sunday’s tragedy.",

    "content": "Tens of thousands of small and medium Australian businesses that rushed to outsource the management of their COVID check-in obligations could find themselves snared in a looming data privacy calamity.At stake are the personal details of millions of Australians who have visited cafes, restaurants and pubs or attended places of worship, wedding and funeral venues since rules designed to help manage the spread of the virus were introduced earlier this year.\n\nThese regulations, which operate in most states and territories, require customers and visitors to provide their name and contact details so that they can be traced in the event there's a potential virus transmission risk.\n\nHowever, many of these electronic check-ins are outsourced to registration platforms that are often owned by companies that deal in collecting data, some operating under opaque rules about how that information is stored and used.Privacy and cybersecurity experts are warning that the lack of due diligence in vetting providers has left the system and the \"gold standard\" personal data it manages vulnerable to exploitation.\n\n\"Governments have made collection compulsory, without exercising supervision about how it is carried out,\" said Graham Greenleaf, a professor of law and information systems at the University of New South Wales (UNSW).The problem is set to be compounded as thousands more venues in Victoria open for business again after a strict three-month lockdown.\n\nThe kind of information being collected is a highly prized commodity with the data broking industry, giving users of that data direct access to a person's inbox and their mobile handset.\n\nAnd there are concerns that the data could potentially be resold, used for identity fraud or to track a person's location and social groups, and employed in micro-targeted advertising for misinformation campaigns.\n\nJustin Warren, from privacy and digital rights group Electronic Frontier Australia (EFA), said while some appeared to be doing the right thing, he had also observed the hallmarks of a \"marketing surveillance\" operation.\n\nHe said the abundance of smaller companies collecting and storing the data had also created a \"honeypot\" for cyber criminals.\n\n\"We have a lot of people whose primary business is running a cafe, they're not technical experts,\" Mr Warren said.\n\n\"[These] conditions really lend to mistakes that people will regret later on. With privacy, once you've lost it, it's kind of gone forever.\"\n\nBig, green tick of approval\nWhile some venues offer patrons a pen and paper solution, the majority use a contactless technology based on scannable QR (quick response) codes.\n\nThe characteristic black squares are essentially a barcode, which when scanned with a smartphone, converts its geometric patterns into readable text — usually a website address.\n\nThe customer types their name and contact details into a form on the web page before submitting the details and receiving a confirmation, often displayed as a big green tick.\n\nBut the ABC found some companies did not have specific COVID privacy policies, as recommended by the federal privacy commissioner.Other companies, such as UberEats rival HungryPanda, didn't appear to make any distinctions between COVID-related data and information it harvested from customers pre-pandemic.\n\nAt least 50 Asian eateries in NSW, many located in Sydney's CBD, using HungryPanda's check-in service defaulted to the app's standard terms and conditions.\n\nThose policies allow the company to share customer details with \"partners for marketing or promotions\".\n\nCompany spokeswoman Tina Sun said there was no intention to collect the COVID check-in data for purposes other than contact tracing.\n\n\"We can't access the data because we didn't want to take the risk,\" she said.\n\nMs Sun said it was up to each business to manage their COVID data and said HungryPanda would again \"remind the restaurants\" about their privacy obligations.\n\nVanessa Teague, cryptography professor and founder of Thinking Cybersecurity, said good intentions weren't enough.\n\n\"A company doesn't always live up to their promises and even if they want to, this doesn't just preclude security problems or accidental data breaches,\" she said.There are no available figures around how many private entities are managing the digital check-in process, nor the volume of check-in data that has been generated.\n\nThe four companies willing to disclose their check-in figures — MyGuestList (MGL), BGL Corporate Solutions, NCH Software and ImpactData — have managed upwards of 28 million COVID registrations since the start of the pandemic.\n\nMGL, which labels itself as \"Australia's Most Powerful Marketing Platform\", has stored over 20 million COVID check-ins across over 20,000 locations in its servers in Canada and backups in the United States.\n\nAn MGL spokesperson said the data was only used for contact tracing and was protected under Canada's more robust privacy laws.NSW so far has the strictest compulsory registrations, with gyms, hospitality venues, funeral homes, and places of public worship all required to collect the names and phone numbers of all patrons.\n\nBut the NSW Government's visitor registration feature that is integrated into the ServiceNSW app is not widely accepted and has only had 1.1 million check-ins since it launched in September.\n\nIn June, the NSW Government said businesses unable to record visitor details would be forbidden from reopening after the COVID lockdown and that non-compliance would be punished with heavy fines.\n\n\"Guidance\" around how that data should be collected and stored was established around the same time by the federal privacy watchdog, the Office of the Australian Information Commission (OAIC).\n\nIt said customers must be clearly informed about what information was being collected, that it should be stored securely, that it should not be used for purposes other than contact tracing and it should be destroyed once it was no longer needed.\n\nIn Queensland, the retention for the data is 56 days, while in other states it is 28 days.An OAIC spokesperson said it had held regular consultations with business groups to advise about \"best privacy practice\" and how to incorporate privacy principles into the design of registration systems.\n\nHowever, some companies were found to be falling short.\n\n\"Some of these applications are asking for a lot more information than they actually need to,\" EFA's Mr Warren said.\n\n\"The regulations are pretty prescriptive, so they say here in Victoria it's just a first name and a contact number.\n\n\"But some of these applications are asking for a lot more information than that including things like last name, email address and other things they could use to potentially track you.\"An example where information has been collected outside the scope of contact tracing is with the free digital check-in service GuestTrack, which allows for the collection of a user's date of birth.\n\nThe app, which has registered over 2 million check-ins across 3,500 businesses, was created by Melbourne-based software and data service company BGL Corporate Solutions.\n\nIts founder, Ron Lesh, said this was an optional feature which had to be enabled by the business itself and that the data was encrypted and BGL did not have access to it.\n\nHe said he created the app in July to \"give back to the community\" and had no intention of profiting from the re-use of COVID check-in data.\n\n'Gold standard data'\nSome of the personal information collected by smaller QR code providers during the \"cowboy period\" before late May, when the OAIC stepped in, could have already ended up in improper hands, according to data commercialisation expert Peter Leonard.\n\n\"It's fair to say that some of the early providers of the apps were not as careful with their information management practices,\" he said.\n\n\"[But] there are probably still some operators who are not really aware of the restrictions that the law imposes and they may still be sharing data in ways that they shouldn't.\"An OAIC spokesperson said it had received about 10 complaints about the collection of information by venues this year, half of which related to QR codes.\n\nThe regulator said it had \"proactively written to a range of digital check-in service providers and related industry groups\" about their privacy obligations.\n\nEven if the OAIC was able to police all breaches — which Mr Leonard says it doesn't have the resources to do, especially if the data moves overseas — there is little incentive for the smaller operators to do the right thing.A spokeswoman for the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner (OVIC) said the privacy regulator was concerned about the lack of oversight on small companies.\n\nWhile the federal regulator can pursue breaches with the big companies, businesses with an annual turnover of less than $3 million are not accountable for any privacy breaches.\n\n\"This means that some small organisations collecting COVID check-in data would not be subject to privacy rules and could potentially misuse check-in data,\" the OVIC spokeswoman said.UNSW's Professor Greenleaf said the information being collected in COVID check-ins was \"gold standard data\".\n\n\"With fragmentary data what you want to be able to do with that is match it with really rock solid identification data about a person,\" Professor Greenleaf said.\n\nHe said an existing database might include search histories of a person looking up particular types of illnesses, operations or medical conditions.\n\n\"They also might have information that you're interested in or susceptible to gambling or pornography,\" he said.\n\n\"But before they didn't really have an effective way of contacting you, now they've got that data, which makes you vulnerable.\"\n\nMr Leonard said for marketers looking to micro-target, having those personal details packaged together could mean paying the \"difference between cents and dollars\" for advertising campaigns.\n\nLooking overseas for solutions\nWhile the check-in measures have helped to allow authorities to quickly trace those exposed to outbreaks, experts say we should look to the United Kingdom and New Zealand to find the balance between public health and privacy.\n\nThe UK recently launched its NHS QR code program, which allows visitors to \"anonymously register\" that they've been to a location.A person would enter a restaurant or public venue, scan a displayed QR code and the information would only be stored locally on the person's device like a personal diary.\n\nWhen a person tests positive to COVID-19, health authorities would access the encrypted data directly from their phone and issue a public health alert about their movements.\n\nOther people can then, through the app, check their own \"diary\" against those locations to determine if they've been exposed.Across the Tasman Sea, the NZ Tracer app worked in a similar way and effectively removed the need for private businesses to manage the digital check-in process.\n\nPrior to the app's introduction in May, NZ authorities were alarmed by potential data mining operations.\n\n\"We definitely had some concerns,\" said Shayne Hunter from the NZ Ministry of Health, who helped develop the app.\n\nWhile many, he said, were individuals or private entities trying to genuinely help, there were some who \"did have thoughts around how they might be able to use the data\".Once the app launched and the Government notified them of new privacy obligations, he said many private providers simply \"disappeared\".\n\n\"I think once they realised we were going down that path, there were a lot who just fell by the wayside,\" Mr Hunter said.\n\nProfessor Teague said the inherent flaw in the Australian model was that the databases existed at all.\n\n\"Instead of architecting things that protect our privacy we are responding by designing things that are inherently invading our privacy,\" she said.\n\n\"And then we get really upset about vulnerable databases … but it wouldn't be vulnerable if it wasn't in existence.\"",

    "content": "Marine Corps M1A1 Abrams tanks of the 2nd Tank Battalion left Camp Lejeune, N.C., for the last time this week as part of the service’s sweeping modernization plan that envisions a more agile force.\n\nTank units on the East and West coasts shuttered this month and began hauling their armor to military depots, the service said.\n\nThe Marine Corps will eventually divest of all three of its active tank battalions as it moves from a “second land army” back to its maritime roots of defending ships at sea, island-hopping and battling for contested coastlines, in preparation for potential conflict with near-peer adversaries such as China.\n\n“We have sufficient evidence to conclude that this capability, despite its long and honorable history in the wars of the past, is operationally unsuitable for our highest-priority challenges in the future,” Commandant Gen. David Berger wrote of the tanks in a March plan for the service’s overhaul. “Heavy ground armor capability will continue to be provided by the U.S. Army.”\n\nThe Corps also plans to trim some 12,000 troops from its ranks by 2030, eliminate law enforcement units, slash the number of cannon artillery battalions, reduce and restructure infantry battalions, and disband many manned aviation units. It will instead build up light armored reconnaissance units, drone squadrons and long-range precision strike capabilities — plans call for the tripling of rocket artillery battalions — among other changes.\n\nAnd the service isn’t dallying. Early this month, the 1st Tank Battalion at Twentynine Palms, Calif., said goodbye to its tanks. Weeks later, Alpha Company, 4th Tank Battalion cased its colors down the road at Camp Pendleton, the first of the Marine Corps Reserve battalion’s six companies expected to do so by the end of 2021. Last week, some 200 West Coast-based Abrams tanks, M-88 Recovery Vehicles and other equipment began moving through the Corps’ logistics base in Barstow, Calif., en route to Army depots in California and Alabama.\n\nHundreds of Marines in tank units will be able to change specialties or transfer into the Army to continue serving as tankers, and those with at least 15 years of service may apply for early retirement, the service has said.\n\n“Remember that our tanks were just weapon systems, albeit a damn fine weapon system,” Capt. Mark Rothcock, Alpha Company commander, said at a July 18 deactivation ceremony. “You individual Marines were always the key to the company’s success.”\n\nOn the East Coast, 2nd Tank Battalion’s Charlie Company cased its colors last Friday, where company commander Capt. John Fergerson recalled the role its tanks played in the second battle for Fallujah in Iraq in 2004.The decision to do away with tanks does not diminish their value in past conflicts, the service’s top officials have said. They just won’t be a part of the Corps’ future.\n\nThe tank units aren’t the only ones packing up. Three combat logistics units in California, North Carolina and Japan also shut down this summer, along with an engineer support battalion and Marine wing support group, both based in California.\n\n“If I were to use one trait to describe the Marine Corps, it would be adaptable,” said 4th Tank Battalion commander Lt. Col. Michael D. O’Quin, citing the service’s history, during Alpha Company’s deactivation. “Now is no different. We will adapt.”",

Students will have the option of studying remotely from home or from their campus residence after spring break.\n\nThe transition to online classes \"will continue until further notice,\" a separate announcement from the UI System said, \"but our expectation is that it will be temporary.\"\n\nThe UI also announced that beginning Friday, it is suspending events that are university-sponsored or hosted by registered student organizations with more than 50 attendees.\n\nThe Engineering and ACES Open Houses, Siblings Weekend and Moms Weekend have already been cancelled, and Commencement could be.\n\n“The University has not yet made this decision,” the UI said about Commencement.\n\nCHAMPAIGN — While it’s business as usual for now, the University of Illinois is exploring the possibility of having to shift to holding classes online due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn a massmail to the UI community, McKinley Health Center Director Robert Parker wrote: “As you know, other universities have announced alternatives to in-person classes for their students. We are continuing to look at a variety of options for delivering classroom instruction, in the event that face-to-face instruction needs to be suspended.”Indiana University, Harvard, Ohio State, Columbia, Princeton and colleges in hard-hit California and Washington state have already announced shifts to online classes.\n\nThe UI’s College of Liberal Arts and Science sent a message to its instructors this week, encouraging them to start thinking about how they’d teach remotely.\n\n“We’re just asking people to start preparing for that possibility,” said Brad Petersen, the college’s spokesman. “And start thinking about basic things like, do you have the equipment you need to do this remotely? The campus does have a license with (video conferencing company) Zoom, so that is one option folks could use.”\n\nOn the athletics side, the NCAA is still “planning to conduct our championships as planned,” COO Donald Remy said, including next week’s college basketball tournaments. “However, we are evaluating the COVID-19 situation daily and will make decisions accordingly.”\n\nIn Parker’s message, he advised those traveling for spring break to check with the CDC and State Department for travel advisories, noting that students returning from CDC Level 2 or 3 countries will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days before they can return to campus.\n\n“The safety level of any given destination could change before or during your trip, making it difficult to return to campus by the March 23 resumption of classes,” Parker wrote.\n\nFor students leaving over spring break, Parker said, “we strongly advise that you take with you everything that you would need to continue your studies if the decision was made to suspend in-person classes.”\n\nThe UI also urged students studying abroad in Europe to leave the continent. It had already required students in Italy to leave.“The incidences of coronavirus across Europe continue to increase. Given these circumstances, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign strongly advises that students reconsider studying abroad in Europe and return to the United States,” the UI’s international safety and security office wrote.\n\n“However, the University is not suspending programs at this time and is not requiring students to depart their program.”\n\nThe UI’s Facilities and Services department said Tuesday that it is taking proactive steps to keep classrooms and campus buildings clean.\n\nIts workers will transition from routine cleaning to disinfecting twice daily.\n\n“The cleaning of any visibly dirty surfaces will remain emphasized as part of the continued response to this emerging public health concern, followed by disinfection as a best-practice measure for the prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses,” F&S Executive Director Mohamed Attalla said.\n\nAnd while there aren’t yet any confirmed cases in Champaign-Urbana, its threat has led to the postponement of at least one event on campus.\n\nThe Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology postponed a symposium scheduled for late March celebrating the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the enzyme Rubisco.\n\n“The symposium organizing committee, in consultation with university administration, have decided that it is prudent and necessary to postpone the Rubisco Oxygenase Symposium due to the COVID-19 situation,” the symposium’s website stated. “We are currently looking into new dates for the symposium for Fall 2020.”",

    "content": "2015 will be an eventful, and testing, year for television in Australia.\n\nIt could be the year that we ask the fundamental question: what is television? A year where Australia rethinks its “free television” philosophy, that tests Australia’s technological infrastructure for its capability to shift toward a television culture encompassing the internet.\n\nThere are a number of factors that will impact television in Australia during 2015. These will include whether the growth in catch-up television continues on from 2014 and the continued roll-out of the National Broadband Network.\n\nIn addition to these, the largest impact will come from the new video-on-demand (VOD) services, including Presto, Stan. and Netflix.But will subscription services such as these survive in Australia? This is a country that has only a 30% uptake of pay television, despite it being available for almost 20 years. This is far from the 1999 prediction of the Foxtel CEO Tom Mockridge, that within 10 years, pay TV would be installed in three-quarters of Australian homes.\n\nCompare this to a report last year that:\n\nGlobal pay-television penetration is forecast to exceed 57% by the end of 2014 and be above 70% of households in over 30 countries. Five countries will account for nearly two thirds of a forecast total of 886 million homes subscribing to television services.\n\nThe challengers\nThe biggest change this year will come from the introduction of the new VOD services, each with their own idiosyncrasies.\n\nPresto\n\nPresto was the first of the three VOD services to launch in Australia. It is a joint venture between Channel Seven and Foxtel. It offers three different subscription packages: either movies or television separately for A$9.99 per month; or both for A$14.99 per month.\n\nYou can access content across a number of devices, including smart phones and tablets, and also stream to your television via Chromecast. The service allows for four devices to be linked with simultaneously streaming to two.\n\nAll of the content available on Presto is streamed at a standard definition resolution, requiring a minimum internet speed of at least 3Mbps.\n\nStan.\n\nLike Presto, Stan. is also a joint venture, including Channel Nine and Fairfax. Unlike Presto, Stan. has a single package, which includes all movies and television entertainment for A$10 per month.\n\nStan. also supports smartphones and tablets, although one key difference with Presto is the ability to stream content to your TV. It includes not only Chromecast, but you can also stream to AppleTV via AirPlay.\n\nStan. provides content up to a High Definition (HD) resolution of 1080p, where available. The appropriate format is automatically determined by your internet speed. The support page lists the minimum internet speed of 1.5Mbps, although for HD content the connection should be above 3.5Mbps for 720p and 6.5mbps for HD 1080p.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix, which started in the US, is the only one of the three services to not have an Australian partner. However, there have been reports that Network Ten was in discussions prior to the launch. If this is true, this would provide all three Australian free-to-air commercial broadcasters a link with a VOD service and an additional outlet for content.\n\nWhilst there is some speculation of the packages that will be available to Australian Netflix customers, it is yet to be officially announced. However, if the US packages are any indication, there could be some key differences between Netflix and the two other services.\n\nFirstly, Netflix allows not only for HD streaming, but also Ultra HD 4K streaming. In the US, prices range from US$7.99 to US$11.99. The additional charges are based upon whether you want SD, HD or Ultra HD (4K), in addition to the number of simultaneous screens you wish to stream to.\n\nAnother point of difference with Netflix is its integration with smart TV manufactures, such as Samsung, LG, Sony, Panasonic, Philips and Hisense, which will have a Netflix app. The service is also integrated with Fetch TV and Apple TV, along with a number of gaming consoles.\n\nWhat about the others?\nWhilst it may appear these are new services available to Australians, this is in fact incorrect. One other streaming service, Quickflix commenced in 2003, although its initial business model was based upon a disc rental service. Since its introduction Quickflix has moved from its disc postage service to a streaming service. By the end of 2014 almost 70% of its customers had access to the streaming service.\n\nQuickflix’s pricing structure has a more complex structure than other services discussed. The streaming only subscription is A$9.99 per month, with the disc postage subscription ranges from A$12.99 to A$29.99 per month, dependant on the number of disc you would like to rent at one time.\n\nIn addition to these two subscription options, Quickflix has premium movies and TV programs service, which are not included in the streaming subscription. These cost A$5.99 each for movies and A$2.99 each for TV programs.\n\nFoxtel has strategically approached its attempt to lift subscriptions in two different ways. The first was lowering the entry point for Foxtel subscription to A$25 per month. The other move made by Foxtel has been its joint venture with the Seven Network to establish Presto.\n\nThe games begin…\nWith Netflix’s launch imminent, Presto and Stan. have been attempting to sweeten their deal to gain a foot hold in the Australian market.\n\nPresto has announced a 30-day trial and is bundling the service with Telstra, including an app for the Telstra T-Box. Telstra mobile customers will also gain some benefits with a longer trial of up to three months. There is no coincidence that Foxtel has a share in both Presto and Telstra.\n\nStan. has also secured a deal with Vodafone, although the details are yet to be confirmed. In addition this could also see subscribers to Fairfax products also be offered exclusive deals for Stan subscriptions.\n\nNetflix, on the other hand, has partnered with Optus and iiNet to offer customers unmetered usage of the VOD service.\n\nAustralians beware!\nWhile many of us are excited by the prospect of getting content at the same time as the US – or much sooner than we are used to – there are some things to be aware of. Firstly, choice is great, but some of us may find ourselves torn between the subscription services, as we review the catalogue on offer from each provider. If you want everything, you may need to subscribe to multiple services.\n\nThe second point is that for each of the three subscription services, it is up to you to supply your own device/s and internet connection. The key devices focused on by these streaming services are smartphones, tablets and PCs, not a traditional television set. If you want to watch them on your TV, you need something to stream them.According to the Australian Multiscreen Report for 2014, the penetration rate of smart phones is 74% for people aged 16 and above, which has increased almost 30% from 2011.\n\nTablet ownership is currently at 45%, although this figure is more than double that of 2012. The percentage of Australians with internet access is currently around 80%, which has only increased 4% from 2011.\n\nThe other key component to make any of these streaming services is the internet, both in terms of speed and access. Currently Australia is ranked 40th in the world for internet speed, with only 14% of the connections above 10Mbps.\n\nWhen analysing a connection speed of 15Mbps or above – which is required for streaming at 4K – we are ranked 36th; less than 6% of Australian internet connections being of the equivalent or above. This means most Australians won’t be able to watch UltraHD via Netflix, which suggests a 25Mbps connection.\n\n2015 for Australian TV\nThis year could see a big change in the way we watch television. However, watching TV will also become more complicated. No longer will it be as easy as purchasing a television set and connecting an antenna.\n\nTV will soon require various communication and media technologies to come together, including internet service providers, broadcasters (both old and new) and technology manufacturers.\n\nIn addition, the biggest determinant of success for internet television and VOD services will be the Australian public. After more than 60 years of free television, how many Australians will incorporate a subscription video service into their television viewing?\n\nAnd if they do, will the overwhelming time spent watching television – currently more than 96 hours per month – begin to fall? Will the average hours we spend watching video online – approximately 12 hours per month – increase?\n\nThese questions are likely to begin to be answered in 2015 as we transition from traditional broadcast TV to the new era of streaming and video-on-demand viewing.",

India has more than 70,000 cases among its 1.3 billion population and is set to surpass China, the origin of the outbreak, within a week.\nPM Modi said strict stay-at-home orders would be extended beyond May 17 with a new set of rules.\n\nIn an address to the nation, he said the package was equivalent to 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and was aimed at the multitudes out of work and the businesses reeling under the prolonged shutdown.\n\nIn March, the government said it was providing around ₹ 1.7 lakh crore ($22.6 billion) in direct cash transfers and food security measures, mainly for the poor, but was widely accused of doing too little.\n\nPM Modi said details of the new package, as well as reforms of land and labour markets, would be released within days: \"The package will also focus on land, labour, liquidity and laws.\"\n\nIt will cater to various sections including cottage industry, medium and small enterprises, labourers, middle class, industries, among others.\n\nEconomists said the new package included the March allocation as well as liquidity measures announced by the central bank worth ₹ 6.5 lakh crore.\n\n\"Headline announcement looks positive... Would include around ₹ 6.5 lakh crore already done by RBI (Reserve Bank of India) and the first package. So - additional is ₹ 13.5 lakh crore,\" said Sandip Sabharwal, a Mumbai-based fund manager.\n\n\"It doesn't match the gross borrowing details of the government so we need to look at details.

How can you quarrel with intent?\"\n\nPM Modi said the reforms of the land and labour markets were intended to make the country more competitive and a big player in global supply chains, some of which could shift away from China after the pandemic.\n\nBusiness leaders say potential investors often choose Vietnam, Thailand or Bangladesh ahead of India because of the time required to buy land for factories, restrictive labour laws and higher borrowing costs.\n\n\"These reforms will promote business, attract investment, and further strengthen 'Made in India',\" PM Modi said.\n\nGovernments and central banks around the world have unleashed unprecedented amounts of fiscal and monetary support for economies that are reeling from the pandemic.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"India's response has so far been tepid compared to other key nations and thus the catch-up is welcome and is also the need of the hour,\" said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Edelweiss FX and Rates.\n\nComments\n\"It needs to be seen how much will be in the form of direct budgetary support to gauge the immediate fiscal hit and the consequent funding sources.\"",

    "content": "The European Commission has today adopted a positive assessment of Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. This is an important step towards the EU disbursing €13.9 billion in grants and €2.7 billion in loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) over the period 2021-2026. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Portugal to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe RRF - at the heart of NextGenerationEU - will provide up to €672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Portuguese plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market.\n\nThe Commission assessed Portugal's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms contained in Portugal's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience.\n\nSecuring Portugal's green and digital transition  \n\nThe Commission's assessment finds that Portugal's plan devotes 38% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes investments to finance a large-scale renovation programme to increase the energy efficiency of buildings or the promotion of energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources in industrial processes.\n\nThe Commission finds that the Portugal's plan devotes 22% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. This includes efforts to digitalise the public administration and to modernise the computer systems of the National Health Service, as well as technological laboratories in secondary schools and professional training centres.\n\nReinforcing Portugal's economic and social resilience\n\nThe Commission considers that Portugal's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Portugal by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures in the areas of accessibility and resilience of social services and the health system, labour market, education and skills, R&D and innovation, climate and digital transition, business environment, quality and sustainability of public finances and efficiency of the justice system.\n\nThe plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Portugal's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation.\n\nSupporting flagship investment and reform projects\n\nPortugal's plan proposes projects in six European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects, which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the green and digital transition. For instance, Portugal has proposed to provide €610 million to renovate public and private buildings to improve their energy performance. This will result in Portugal reducing its energy bill, greenhouse gas emissions and energy dependence, as well as reducing energy poverty.\n\nThe assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation.\n\nThe control systems put in place by Portugal are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: “Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Portugal's €16.6 billion recovery and resilience plan, the first to be endorsed by the Commission. The plan was designed in Portugal. The reforms and investments contained in this plan will allow Portugal to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the future. In short, it will help build a better future for the Portuguese people. We will stand by Portugal every step of the way. Your success will be our success. A European success.”\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: “Portugal was the first country to present its plan and today we are happy to confirm our positive assessment. This is a solid plan that will put Portugal on a path of higher growth, create new jobs for the future as well as stronger and sustainable social protection. The proposed measures cover a broad spectrum of reforms and investments to equip Portugal for the green and digital transition, ranging from digitalising the public administration, improving workers' skills, creating energy-efficient housing, to better protecting the country's vast forests. I also welcome the plan's strong social focus, including measures to improve childcare and strengthen the health care system. This plan will allow Portugal to grow back stronger. We will now work closely with Portugal on its full implementation.”\n\nPaolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: “The reforms and investments included in the Portuguese plan will enhance the country's resilience and give a strong boost to its climate transition and digital transformation efforts. With its measures to support social services, the national health service and education and training, the plan also has a very strong social dimension. This is our first completed assessment of a national recovery and resilience plan, marking a key milestone in the implementation of NextGenerationEU. And it is fitting that the first plan to be assessed positively is Portugal's: not only because it was the first to be submitted, but also because the Portuguese Presidency played such a key role in putting in place the legal and financial framework for this unprecedented common European endeavour.”\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide €13.9 billion in grants and €2.7 billion in loans to Portugal under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal.\n\nThe Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of €2.2 billion to Portugal in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Portugal.\n\nThe Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms",

    "content": "PARIS — As Ella Fitzgerald used to sing, “T’ain’t what you do, it’s the way that you do it.”\n\nThat also applies to financial services and trade agreements.\n\nAnd keeping the song in mind helps lift the veil of hypocrisy clouding the cross-arguments of the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the U.K. government over what the yet-to-be-negotiated, long-term deal between the two sides will include after their separation.Barnier has warned that it would be a trade agreement, period. The implication was that any deal would only cover goods and mimic the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which Canada and the EU negotiated over a period of many years before it entered into force last September.\n\nThe U.K., on the other hand, is looking for a treaty that would encompass services, most notably financial services, to maintain the role of London as a global financial center. To which Barnier has sternly replied: “There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn’t exist.”What Barnier omitted to mention was that even the CETA deal has a section on financial services.\n\nIn a speech Tuesday, he reiterated that a post-Brexit trade deal could provide close regulatory cooperation, similar to existing agreements with Japan and the U.S., but nixed a deal that would allow the free flowing of financial services.\n\nWhat Barnier said is not exactly true. But contrary to some hopes expressed in London, that doesn’t mean he is bluffing either.\n\nThe Canada option is the only one left on the table after all other existing possibilities have been ruled out, due to the U.K.’s own interpretation of what Brexit means. The narrowing down of possible scenarios is illustrated by the now-famous “Barnier slide” giving a graphical representation of the downgrading of the future relationship when options are weighed against stated British red lines.\n\nWhat Barnier omitted to mention was that even the CETA deal has a section on financial services — and according to a European Parliament report on trade deals from 2014, it is even the only modern trade agreement to dedicate a special chapter to the matter.So if it accepts the Canada model, the U.K. will have an agreement with some provisions on financial services. It, however, isn't likely to like what it gets.\n\nMost notably, the EU-Canada deal stops way short of allowing the so-called passporting that U.K. financial firms are so keen to retain to enable them to operate throughout the single market after having only registered in one member country.\n\nAsymmetric negotiations\nThe diverging approaches of the U.K. and Barnier stem from the fundamental asymmetry of the negotiations, noted a French government adviser. “The U.K. wants to preserve as much as it can from the current situation. Their viewpoint is they’re in, and what’s being discussed is simply stripping away some components of the edifice.”\n\nBarnier and the EU, on the other hand, start from the position that everything has to be built or rebuilt “from the bottom up” once the U.K. is legally out of the EU, the French official added. The aim of the talks is indeed to come to a compromise, and Barnier’s legal and even legalistic stance is the EU side’s starting point.\n\nAnything the U.K. hopes to obtain on top of the minimal financial services component in the EU-Canadian deal will also be constrained by CETA’s “most favored nation” clause, which compels the EU to offer Ottawa the same terms it might concede with London.\n\nAnd even though nothing prevents the EU from deciding it does want an ambitious agreement with the U.K. — which, contrary to the EU party line, will be as “bespoke” as most other trade deals concluded in recent years — London’s goals will be constrained by both time and EU politics.\n\nFirst, it will take more than the two years of the planned transition to negotiate a deal that would encompass financial services.\n\nThe EU doesn’t have any reason to extend a sweet deal to the U.K.\n\n“Trade is easy, you check stuff at the border,” a European official said. “Services, especially financial services, are a whole other game. You need common rules, and a common arbiter whenever there’s a legal disagreement.”\n\nIn other words, it all hinges on the degree of regulatory alignment the U.K. is ready to accept as a price for its access to the EU market.\n\n“To take an extreme example, you don’t allow a Nigerian bank or investment fund to come to the EU and solicit investors,\" he added. \"But a Nigerian car, if it did exist, wouldn’t raise any question. You check it at the border, and it’s in.”\n\nThen of course, there’s the politics of it all. The EU doesn’t have any reason to extend a sweet deal to the U.K., other than wanting to avoid reaching the level where intransigence would turn into self-harm.\n\n“The only question is what our interests are, both collectively and of course for individual countries,” the European official noted.\n\n“Once we’re clear among ourselves on this, there will be little the U.K. can do other than accept what we’re prepared to give it.”",

    "content": "With Australia moving to make the tech companies pay for news, Facebook took a hard line, while Google has struck deals to pay publishers.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — For months, Facebook and Google have been locked in a stare-down with news publishers and lawmakers in Australia.\n\nAt the heart of the fight is whether the tech giants should pay news organizations for the news articles that are shared on their networks. Under a proposed law from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, both Google and Facebook would be required to negotiate with media publishers and compensate them for the content that appears on their sites.\n\nFacebook and Google have fought hard to prevent the Australian law — which is expected to pass this week or next — from forcing their hands. But on Wednesday, the two companies sharply diverged on how to head off that regulatory future.\n\nGoogle began the day by unveiling a three-year global agreement with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp to pay for the publisher’s news content, one of several such deals it has announced recently where it appears to be effectively capitulating to publishers’ demands. Hours later, Facebook took the opposite tack and said it would restrict people and publishers from sharing or viewing news links in Australia, in a move that was effective immediately.\n\nIn conciliatory language toward publishers, Don Harrison, president for global partnerships at Google, said that the company had invested to help news organizations over the years and that it hoped “to announce even more partnerships soon.”\n\nFacebook struck a distinctly different tone. “The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” William Easton, managing director of Facebook Australia and New Zealand, said of the draft Australian legislation.\n\nThe divergence illustrates the different ways that Facebook and Google approach news. For years, the two internet giants had treated news publishers more or less the same. Both had little incentive to pay news outlets for content and argued, correctly, that they helped drive a lot of readers to news stories that would otherwise go unnoticed on lightly trafficked websites.\n\nBut the steady decline of newspapers — juxtaposed against the billions of dollars Google and Facebook reaped in digital advertising — intensified questions over whether the platforms had a responsibility to financially support publishers. In recent years, both companies started paying news organizations through various programs as criticism about misinformation on their platforms seemed to heighten the need for quality journalism.\n\nNow the situation in Australia has underlined that the lockstep approach can go only so far because Facebook and Google ultimately value news differently. Google’s mission statement has long been to organize the world’s information, an ambition that is not achievable without up-to-the-minute news. For Facebook, news is not as central. Instead, the company positions itself as a network of users coming together to share photos, political views, internet memes, videos — and, on occasion, news articles.“Google is already used to playing a different game in every different country,” Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia, said of the companies’ different approaches. While he said Facebook was taking what it considers a moral stance, Google “may have gotten beyond this fantasy of a universalized approach to doing business in the world.”\n\nPaul Fletcher, Australia’s communications minister, said the government would move forward with the legislation even as conversations with Facebook continue.\n\nIn interviews, he praised Google for engaging with the process and suggested that Facebook would be closely scrutinized for deciding to “remove all authoritative and credible news sources from the platform.” In an interview with 2GB radio, Mr. Fletcher added that the decision “certainly raises issues about the credibility of information on the platform.”\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the country’s top competition authority, has spent the past year drafting a bill for the Australian Parliament that would require Facebook and Google to negotiate with media publishers and pay them for content. The legislation includes a code of conduct that would allow media companies to bargain individually or collectively with digital platforms over the value of their news content.\n\nGoogle and Facebook saw the proposed legislation as a worrisome precedent. As the negotiations over the proposal continued throughout 2020, both companies openly said that they might have to resort to more drastic measures against it.\n\nIn August, Facebook said it would block users and news organizations in Australia from sharing local and international news stories on its social network and Instagram if the bill were to move forward. Last month, Google also threatened to make its search engine unavailable in Australia if the government approved the legislation.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Google has sought to blunt the impact of the proposed legislation by striking deals with media companies such as Reuters and The Financial Times. Last year, Google said it would commit to paying $1 billion in license fees over three years to news publishers for content that shows up within Google’s News page, as well as Discover, the news feed that appears in Google’s mobile search app.Google’s agreement on Wednesday with Mr. Murdoch’s News Corp was particularly notable. Both have shown open animosity toward each other for years, dating back to the earliest days of the search engine.\n\nIn 2009, Mr. Murdoch threatened to remove News Corp articles from Google, accusing the internet giant of stealing its content. Google has long suspected that Mr. Murdoch and News Corp stoked growing antitrust scrutiny in Washington and among state attorneys general, according to current and former Google executives.\n\nUnder the two companies’ agreement, Google agreed to pay News Corp for use of its news content without disclosing specific markets or dollar amounts.\n\nBut the search giant did not concede a major sticking point in past negotiations, according to two people familiar with the agreement. The agreement doesn’t appear to explicitly include paying for links and snippets of news stories that appear in general search results, the main source of Google’s power.\n\nIn a news release declaring victory for its “quixotic quest” to get Google to pay for news, News Corp also said the agreement included the development of a subscription platform and investments into video journalism by YouTube, a Google subsidiary.\n\nFacebook’s decision on Wednesday was consistent with its past statements about blocking news links in Australia. The move could prove deeply difficult for Australians, with publishers no longer being able to share or post any content from their Facebook pages and users unable to view news articles shared on Facebook by overseas publishers.\n\nWithin Australia, Facebook’s news ban seemed to roll out haphazardly. News pages worked and then didn’t work, with error messages for some users and streams of posts disappearing for others.\n\nBut by 9 a.m. in Sydney, the impact was apparent and even more wide-reaching than Facebook’s statements suggested. In addition to news publishers being blocked, pages for Fire and Rescue New South Wales, the Bureau of Meteorology and state police departments had all been wiped clean. Even state government pages with public health information about the pandemic were blocked, prompting outrage from many officials and lawmakers including Senator Sarah Hanson-Young of South Australia.\n\nIn a statement, Facebook’s Mr. Easton said that the social network had largely helped the media industry and that publishers would not be able to increase their revenue in the same way without the company’s aid.\n\n“The value exchange between Facebook and publishers runs in favor of the publishers,” he said. “Last year Facebook generated approximately 5.1 billion free referrals to Australian publishers worth an estimated AU$407 million.”\n\nJosh Frydenberg, the Australian Federal Treasurer and deputy leader of the Liberal Party, said in a tweet that he and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, had a “constructive discussion” on Wednesday.\n\nThey would continue to “try and find a pathway forward,” Mr. Frydenberg said.",

    "content": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – The Mountain West has announced the indefinite postponement of all scheduled fall sports contests and MW championship events in response to ongoing challenges with the effective mitigation and management of the COVID-19 virus in conjunction with athletic competition. The MW Board of Directors prioritized the physical and mental health and well-being of the Conference’s student-athletes and overall campus communities in its decision – as it has done throughout the course of the pandemic.\n\nThe fall sports affected by today’s decision include men’s and women’s cross country, football, women’s soccer and women’s volleyball (with the exception of the unique circumstances involved with the military service academies). Last week, the league announced that all fall competition in the sports of men’s and women’s golf, men’s and women’s tennis, women’s swimming and diving, men’s and women’s indoor track and field, softball and baseball was canceled. At this time, there are ongoing discussions regarding the status of winter sports. \n\nThe Mountain West will begin to explore the feasibility of rescheduling fall sports competition, including the possibility of those sports competing in the spring, and develop options for consideration. Athletically-related activities and training opportunities for enrolled student-athletes will also be evaluated consistent with NCAA legislation and guidance, as well as state, local and campus parameters.\n\n“Nothing is more important than the health and well-being of our students, student-athletes, coaches, faculty, staff and overall communities,” said Dr. Mary Papazian, President at San José State University and Chair of the MW Board of Directors. “Through the hard work of many over the past several months, the Conference made every effort to create an opportunity for our student-athletes to compete, and we empathize with the disappointment this creates for everyone associated with our programs. The best interests of our students and student-athletes remain our focus and we will persist in our efforts to forge a viable and responsible path forward.”\n\n“Since the start of the pandemic, our membership and staff have been working diligently to prepare for a fall sports season,” said MW Commissioner Craig Thompson. “We were hopeful we could carefully and responsibly conduct competition as originally scheduled with essential protocols in place. However, numerous external factors and unknowns outside our control made this difficult decision necessary. I fully understand the impact of this outcome on our student- athletes, coaches, administrators and staff who work so hard daily to play the sports we all love, and I share in their disappointment. We will continue to navigate this pandemic together, overcome the obstacles and return to intercollegiate athletics at the earliest opportunity.”",

    "content": "Remember the vast and mysterious Fermi bubbles, apparent remnants of a titanic explosion close to the supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy? They were widely discussed around the year 2010, noticeable in X-ray and gamma ray data from the ROSAT and Fermi satellites. Astronomers said today (October 6, 2019) that they’ve uncovered more evidence relating the Fermi bubbles – gathered using Hubble Space Telescope data – in the form of two enormous bursts of ionizing radiation that must have zipped through the poles of our galaxy and out into deep space. One burst must have been powerful enough to reach 200,000 light-years into space, so that its impact struck the Magellanic Stream, a long trail of gas extending from the nearby Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, dwarf galaxies orbiting our Milky Way.\n\nAll of this activity from our Milky Way’s center – the explosion and its aftermath – apparently occurred just 3.5 million years ago when, on Earth, the asteroid that triggered the extinction of the dinosaurs was already 63 million years in the past, and humanity’s ancient ancestors, the australopithecines, were roaming in Africa.\n\nThey estimate that the blast lasted for perhaps 300,000 years, a long time in human terms, but an exceedingly short time as measured on the scale of galaxies.The astronomers who recently discovered the flare event – impacting the Magellanic Stream – said they noticed it because:\n\n… some Stream clouds towards both galactic poles are highly ionized by a source capable of producing ionization energies up to at least 50 eV [electronvolts].\n\nAnd these researchers associate this ionization with the blast that created the Fermi bubbles.\n\nThese new findings come from a team of scientists led by astronomer Joss Bland-Hawthorn from Australia’s ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D). They are soon to be published in the peer-reviewed Astrophysical Journal.\n\nAbout 10% of all galaxies are known to have flares of this kind, which are called Seyfert flares. Our galaxy isn’t generally considered a Seyfert galaxy, or a particularly active galaxy at all. But the Milky Way is known to have a 4-million-solar-mass black hole at its heart, called Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star). Even earlier this year, Sgr A* was caught having an unusually large meal of gas and dust.\n\nSo astronomers are learning that the Milky Way, too, can sometimes have a burst of activity, although it’s minor in contrast to true active galaxies.\n\nThe explosion 3.5 million years ago was too huge to have been triggered by anything other than nuclear activity associated with Sgr A*, said the team who studied it. Bland-Hawthorn commented:\n\nThe flare must have been a bit like a lighthouse beam. Imagine darkness, and then someone switches on a lighthouse beacon for a brief period of time.\n\nLisa Kewley, director of ASTRO 3D, said:\n\nThis is a dramatic event that happened a few million years ago in the Milky Way’s history. A massive blast of energy and radiation came right out of the galactic center and into the surrounding material. This shows that the center of the Milky Way is a much more dynamic place than we had previously thought. It is lucky we’re not residing there!Bottom line: Researchers have found evidence of a cataclysmic flare that punched outward in both directions from our galaxy’s center, reaching so far into intergalactic space that its impact was felt 200,000 light-years away. They associate this new discovery with the Fermi bubbles, apparent remnants of a titanic explosion close to the supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy, some 3.5 million years ago.",

He overcame that stigma on Saturday with the goal that gave Argentina a 1-0 victory over Brazil in the final of the Copa America at the Maracana Stadium.\n\n“I can’t cry, I can’t fall, we dreamed so much of achieving this. So many people said I shouldn’t come back, I kept banging my head against the wall and today it happened,” the veteran winger said after the match in Rio de Janeiro. His goal gave Argentina its first major title in 28 years.\n\nArgentina’s winner came in the 22nd minute after Rodrigo de Paul made a long pass to Di Maria. The 33-year-old striker counted on poor defending by Brazil left-back Renan Lodi to take control and lob it past goalkeeper Ederson.\n\nDi Maria, captain Lionel Messi and striker Sergio Agüero are the sole survivors of the squad that lost the 2014 World Cup final in Brazil. They also experienced defeat against Chile in the deciders of Copa America in 2015 and 2016.The winger had several setbacks due to injury.\n\n“(Messi) said ‘thank you’ and I said ‘thank you’ to him. He told me it was going to be my final,” an emotional Di Maria said. “Soccer is like this, comebacks are like this and it had to be today.”\n\nDi Maria didn’t play in the 2014 World Cup final due to an injury in the quarterfinals against Belgium. One year later, another muscle injury forced him out during the Copa America final against Chile. He was also unfit during the Copa America Centenario decider in 2016.\n\nThat is when Di Maria started seeing a psychiatrist. Argentina fans wanted him out of the squad, but he turned the tables on them on Saturday, despite the fact he started the tournament as a substitute.\n\n.Di Maria promised more joy for Argentina fans after the Copa title Saturday.\n\n“This is enough to continue here. The World Cup is coming soon, and this is a great push,” he said.\n\n___",

On 10 September, a ministerial meeting on contaminated water and decommissioning issues concluded that \"a team to collect expertise from all over the world and to invite proposals of countermeasures would be established.\"\n\nIn particular, proposals are being sought for dealing with: the accumulation of contaminated water (in storage tanks, etc); the treatment of contaminated water; the removal of radioactive materials from the seawater in the plant's harbour; the management of contaminated water inside the buildings; management measures to block groundwater from flowing into the site; and, understanding the flow of groundwater.\n\nSome 400 tonnes of water is being continuously poured into the damaged reactor buildings at Fukushima Daiichi every day to cool them. In addition, another 400 tonnes of groundwater is flowing into the basements of the buildings and being contaminated each day. Around 800 tonnes of water is therefore being pumped out every day and being treated for caesium removal and desalination. While half of this water is being reused for cooling the reactors, some 400 tonnes is being put in storage tanks.\n\nPlant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) plans to transfer the contaminated water currently stored in the bolted storage tanks to tanks with welded seams. Proposals are being sought for the supply of suitable replacement tanks or suggestions for other methods of storing large amounts of contaminated water on the site. Technology to detect minor leaks is also being sought.\n\nWhile the current decontamination equipment at Fukushima Daiichi is able to remove caesium from the contaminated water, it is unable to remove the tritium in it. Proposals are being sought for suitable tritium removal equipment.\n\nIdeas are also being requested for technologies to conduct faster groundwater sampling and analysis, so as to better monitor the flow of water into the reactor buildings as well as into the sea. The government has also requested proposals for stopping groundwater flowing into the reactor buildings, as well as preventing contaminated water flowing out of the buildings.\n\nAn information workshop for this request for proposals has been organized for interested parties. At the meeting - to be held in Tokyo on 2 October - an overview of the contaminated water issues and government approaches to these issues will be presented.\n\nAn invitation to submit advice and technology suggestions has been posted on the website of the newly-created International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID).

[nL8N2AE2OU]\n\nIt has swabbed nearly 900,000 people, more than 15% of its 5.7 million population, according to official data - one of the highest per capita rates globally.Dormitory residents have been put on a rostered testing regime, authorities have undertaken mass testing among vulnerable communities like care homes, and anyone over 13 with signs of acute respiratory infection is offered a free test.\n\n“The more we diagnose, then the lower the mortality rate is,” said Hsu Li Yang at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at National University of Singapore.\n\nHOSPITALISATION\nThe pre-emptive approach has also applied to treatment. COVID-19 patients above the age of 45 years or with underlying conditions that make them vulnerable are cared for in hospital even if they are otherwise well, doctors said.\n\n“Our care is conventional but done well; fluid management, anticoagulation and both proven drugs and participation in drug trials,” said Dale Fisher, a senior consultant at Singapore’s National University Hospital.\n\nSingapore was already a medical tourism hub for Southeast Asia, with numerous private hospitals and high quality public healthcare facilities. It also built up bed space for coronavirus patients in cavernous exhibition halls and other temporary facilities to house those with mild or no symptoms.\n\nThis prevented the healthcare system from being overwhelmed so that attention and resources could be focused on the more severe cases, doctors said. Singapore currently has no COVID-19 patients in intensive care, while 42 are warded in hospital and a further 490 in temporary facilities.MANDATORY MASKS\nThe city-state made masks mandatory in public in April. While experts have said more studies need be done, there is growing evidence that wearing masks helps reduce the prevalance and severity of the virus. The WHO has recommended the use of masks in combination with other social distancing measures.\n\n“We have adopted a good mask culture in Singapore. This makes the disease milder,” said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert at the city’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital.\n\nCLASSIFICATION\nSingapore sticks rigidly to the WHO’s case definition for classifying COVID-19 deaths. It does not include non-pneumonia fatalities like those caused by blood or heart issues among COVID-19 patients in its official tally.\n\n“I have no doubt that if the WHO revises its case definitions, some of the non-pneumonia deaths will be reclassified and the mortality rate will change,” said Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, without specifying how much it would likely shift.\n\nThe health ministry has said its approach is consistent with international practice, although some countries like Britain have taken broader counts. NUH’s Fisher said any change from reclassifications in Singapore would be marginal.",

A day after that, money landed in our bank account, so we paid our rent, fed our kids and breathed out for a moment knowing we would be OK,\" he said via social media.\n\nBut he had a feeling of guilt watching the virus tidal wave hitting the same sector in Australia.\n\n\"Guilt because I'm having my arse saved by a foreign government while the government of my homeland hangs my friends, collaborators and entire professional cohort out to dry,\" he said.\n\nPerforming online not sustainable\nStruggling award-winning Australian theatre performer Michaela Burger had also heard of the German stance of support.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking, we've been in contact with a lot of friends in, for example Germany, who have been looked after by the Government and who were really taken care of the minute this happened, whereas the arts in Australia seems to have been forgotten,\" she said from her Melbourne isolation base.\n\nBurger saw her income for the year disappear as the COVID-19 disease shut down Australia.\n\nShe immediately began online shows several times a week, which worked OK, albeit temporarily.\n\n\"Slowly though the donations have become less and less until it's almost nothing,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not even enough to pay our rent, so it'll be interesting to see what kind of help we can end up getting.\"\n\nShe said she had applied to Centrelink.Some companies have gone entirely online in the hope that, with the help of previous public funding, they would survive.\n\nThe Australian Dance Theatre (ADT) should break even financially, despite deciding early to keep paying its dancers.\n\n\"We made the decision not to stand down any staff, so our business staff and our dancers will be employed as they would have been without this crisis happening,\" ADT executive director Nick Hays said.\n\nCalls for multi-million-dollar rescue package\nChildren's company Windmill Theatre had to abandon an American tour when the pandemic began closing international borders.\n\nIt has also committed to honouring performers' contracts for the rest of the year.\n\n\"Our company is nothing without our incredible artists so that was our number one priority,\" theatre artistic director Rosemary Myers said.But most across the nation are missing out, with an estimated $330 million in paid performances cancelled.\n\nActor Ellen Steele is one of the lucky ones working with Windmill, but was worried about the mental health of others.\n\n\"There's a lot of fear, it's been devastating actually.

    "content": "Tasmanian devils have been released into the wild on Australia's mainland 3,000 years after the feisty marsupials went extinct there, in what conservationists described Monday as a \"historic\" step. Aussie Ark, along with a coalition of other conservation groups, revealed Monday that they had released 26 of the carnivorous mammals into a 1,000-acre sanctuary at Barrington Tops, about 3.5 hours north of Sydney.\n\nTim Faulkner, president of Aussie Ark, said the \"historic\" releases in July and September were the first steps in a project akin to the successful move to return wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the United States in the 1990s.\n\nAfter 16 years of work, including the establishment of mainland Australia's largest Tasmanian devil breeding program, Faulkner said it was \"incredible and surreal\" to have reached the goal.It's the stuff dreams are made of,\" he told AFP. \"Our biggest native mainland predator is the tiger quoll -- and they're just over a kilo -- so to be bringing back something of this enormity is huge.Tasmanian devils, which weigh up to 18 pounds and have a black or brown coat, typically prey on other native animals or scavenge carcasses.\n\nAccording to government environmental authorities, devils are not dangerous to humans or livestock but will defend themselves if attacked and can cause serious injury.\n\nThe animals -- known for their extremely loud growl, powerful jaws and ferocity when confronting rivals over food or mates -- are classified as endangered after a contagious facial tumor disease ravaged the remaining population on the Australian island state of Tasmania.It is estimated that fewer than 25,000 Tasmanian devils still live in the wild, down from as many as 150,000 before the mysterious, fatal disease first struck in the mid-1990s.\n\nOn Australia's mainland, they are believed to have been wiped out by packs of dingoes -- wild dogs native to the vast continent -- an estimated 3,000 years ago.\n\nFaulkner said it was hoped the project would create an \"insurance population\" against the face-tumour disease, which has so far proved untreatable, and help restore the native environment.\n\n\"Devils present one of the only natural solutions to the control of fox and the cat, and the fox and cat are responsible for nearly all of our 40 mammal extinctions (in Australia),\" he added.\n\n\"So there's more than the devil at stake here.\"Aussie Ark selected the reintroduced devils for their breeding suitability, placing them in the sprawling, fenced area in the hopes of warding off threats to their survival including feral pests, noxious weeds and cars.\n\n\"We've put young, healthy devils in, we put them in now which gives them the best part of six months to settle, find their territory (and) prepare for breeding\" which usually occurs in February, Faulkner said.\n\nAnother 40 are set to be released over the next two years into the sanctuary, which is on land bought by Aussie Ark for its habitat suitability, high number of herbivores and location near a national park.\n\n\"The land initially was selected because it's just like a slice of Tasmania,\" Faulkner said.\n\nHe said he was confident that close monitoring as the Tasmanian devils make the \"massive transition\" back to the wild -- where they have no supplied food, water or shelter for the first time in their lives -- would ensure the program's early success.\n\nAs part of the \"ambitious\" rewilding scheme, Aussie Ark plans to eventually introduce more of the animals to unfenced areas, where they will contend with a much greater range of new threats including the country's notorious bushfires.\n\nThe Tasmanian devil is one of seven cornerstone species critical to Australia's ecosystem that Aussie Ark plans to reintroduce to the wild sanctuary in the coming years, along with quolls, bandicoots and rock wallabies.",

Dubbed COP26, it is to be held there in early November 2021.\n\nJapan’s Environment Ministry has led an initiative called the Online Platform for Sustainable and Resilient Recovery from COVID-19, or “Platform for Redesign 2020.” Its website says it is a hub that collates countries’ climate and other environmental policies and actions that are planned and implemented in the context of recovery from COVID-19.\n\nGuterres noted that Japan’s advanced technology in many fields should make it a leader in shifting to renewable energy and urged it to stop financing construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe top priorities, he said, are prioritizing “green” jobs, ending subsidies for use of fossil fuels and taking energy and climate change issues into account in all decisions.\n\n“Clean energy delivers more jobs, cleaner air, better health and stronger economic growth,” Guterres said.\n\n“It makes no sense economically to burn money on coal plants that will soon become stranded assets,” he added. “There is simply no rational case for coal power in any investment plan.”\n\nJapan scaled back its ambitions for shifting to renewable energy after the massive March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown disasters in the northeastern Tohoku region led it to close down its nuclear power plants for safety overhauls.\n\nSome have restarted but most have not. In the meantime, the country has made up for lost power generating capacity by boosting use of coal, oil and gas, ramping up use of solar power and reducing waste.\n\nThe government also has sought to export its expertise and technology by helping to finance construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\nGuterres said the goals of halving global emissions by 2030 and achieving “carbon neutrality” by 2050 — key to limiting global warming — were achievable, “but we are currently off track.”He urged countries participating in the conference to come up with more ambitious plans and long-term strategies before COP26 next year.\n\nIn comments delivered on the website Platform for Redesign 2020, Japan’s environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, said the endeavor aims to help countries “redesign their economic and social systems in this time of dual crises.”\n\nThe pandemic has slowed most activities, he noted, but “climate change gives us no time to waste.”\n\n“Our task is not to return to the pre-pandemic world, but to build back better,” he said.",

    "content": "Dozens of protesters gathered in Bangladesh's capital of Dhaka on Friday to demand justice for an 18-year-old woman who died after being set on fire for refusing to drop sexual harassment charges against her Islamic school's principal. Nusrat Jahan Rafi told her family she was lured to the roof of her rural school in the town of Feni on April 6 and asked to withdraw the charges by five people clad in burqas.\n\n\nWhen she refused, she said her hands were tied and she was doused in kerosene and set alight. Rafi told the story to her brother in an ambulance on the way to the hospital and he recorded her testimony on his mobile phone.\n\n\"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath,\" Rafi said in the video, according to BBC News. She also identified some of her attackers as students at the school.Rafi died four days later in a Dhaka hospital with burns covering 80 percent of her body. The violence has shaken Bangladesh, triggering protests and raising concerns over the plight of women and girls in the conservative Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people where sexual harassment and violence are often unreported, victims are intimidated and the legal process is often lengthy.\n\nMany avoid reporting to police because of social stigma. \"We want justice. Our girls must grow up safely and with dignity,\" Alisha Pradhan, a model and actress, told The Associated Press during Friday's demonstration. \"We protest any forms of violence against women, and authorities must ensure justice.\"Tens of thousands of people attended Rafi's funeral prayers in Feni, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised Rafi's family when they met in Dhaka that those responsible would be punished. At least 17 people, including students, have been arrested in connection with the case, said Banaj Kumar Majumder, the head of the Police Bureau of Investigation.\n\nIn late March, Rafi filed a complaint with police that the principal of her madrasa, or Islamic school, had called her into his office and touched her inappropriately and repeatedly. Her family agreed to help her file the police complaint, which prompted police to arrest the principal, infuriating him and his supporters.Influential local politicians backed the principal, and ruling party members were also among the arrested. Police said the arrested suspects told them during interrogations that the attack on Rafi was planned and ordered by the school's principal from prison when his men went to see him.\n\nIt was timed for daytime so that it would look like a suicide attempt, Majumder said. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that Rafi's family said that they had received death threats before the attack telling them to drop the case.\n\nWhile Rafi's case is now being treated with urgency, that wasn't the case until her death. A video taken on March 27 while Rafi reported the assault shows the local police chief registering her complaint but telling her that the incident was \"not a big deal.\"\n\nThe chief was later removed from the police station for negligence in dealing with the case. For Bangladeshi women, it is often not easy to file sensitive complaints with police.\n\nVictims often fear further harassment and bullying. Police also often show an unwillingness to investigate such cases and are often accused of being influenced by local politics or bribes.\n\nBut the call for dealing with violence against women, especially related to sexual harassment and assault, is also getting louder. \"The horrifying murder of a brave woman who sought justice shows how badly the Bangladesh government has failed victims of sexual assault,\" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"Nusrat Jahan Rafi's death highlights the need for the Bangladesh government to take survivors of sexual assault seriously and ensure that they can safely seek a legal remedy and be protected from retaliation.\"",

    "content": "Today NOAA issued the scheduled update for its 2017 hurricane season outlook. Forecasters are now predicting a higher likelihood of an above-normal season, and they increased the predicted number of named storms and major hurricanes. The season has the potential to be extremely active, and could be the most active since 2010.\n\nForecasters now say there is a 60-percent chance of an above-normal season (compared to the May prediction of 45 percent chance), with 14-19 named storms (increased from the May predicted range of 11-17) and 2-5 major hurricanes (increased from the May predicted range of 2-4). A prediction for 5-9 hurricanes remains unchanged from the intial May outlook.  “We’re now entering the peak of the season when the bulk of the storms usually form,” said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. “The wind and air patterns in the area of the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean where many storms develop are very conducive to an above-normal season. This is in part because the chance of an El Nino forming, which tends to prevent storms from strengthening, has dropped significantly from May.”\n\nBell noted other factors that point to an above-normal season include warmer waters across the tropical Atlantic than models previously predicted and higher predicted activity from available models.\n\nIn just the first nine weeks of this season there have been six named storms, which is half the number of storms during an average six-month season and double the number of storms that would typically form by early August. An average Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1-November 30, produces 12 named storms, of which six become hurricanes, including three major hurricanes.“Today’s updated outlook underscores the need for everyone to know their true vulnerabilities to storms and storm surge,” said FEMA Administrator Brock Long. “As we enter the height of hurricane season, it’s important for everyone to know who issues evacuation orders in their community, heed the warnings, update their insurance and have a preparedness plan.”\n\nThe updated outlook is based on the current and evolving atmospheric and oceanic conditions, the most recent model predictions, and pre-and early-season storm activity. The numbers announced today include the season activity to-date. The Atlantic basin has seen six named storms (Arlene in April; Bret and Cindy in June; Don and Emily in July; and Franklin in August). Two of these storms, Cindy and Emily, struck the United States. Cindy made landfall on June 22 at the Louisiana-Texas border and caused heavy rain, inland flooding and multiple tornado outbreaks. Emily made landfall on July 31 in Anna Maria Island, Florida. Franklin is predicted to make landfall in Mexico overnight as a hurricane.\n\nToday’s update also decreases the chance of a near-normal season from 35 percent to 30 percent, and a below-normal season from 20 percent to only 10 percent from the initial outlook issued in May.\n\nAs we move into the peak of hurricane season, when hurricanes are most frequent and at their strongest, NOAA urges coastal residents to make sure they have their hurricane preparedness plans in place and to monitor the latest forecasts.",

    "content": "The United Nations chief urged Japan and other wealthy nations on Thursday to give up their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels and commit to investments in green energy as they recover from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made the appeal in an address to an online climate conference hosted by Japan.\n\nGuterres noted that many countries are using the opportunity of the pandemic to double down on green energy and other initiatives, aiming to attain a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average.\n\n“We are facing two critical crises, COVID and climate change,” he said in pre-recorded remarks. He said he hoped the meeting would “leave future generations with the hope that this moment is the true turning point for people and the planet.”\n\nA major U.N. Climate Change Conference due to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, this November was postponed due to the pandemic. Dubbed COP26, it is to be held there in early November 2021.\n\nJapan’s Environment Ministry has led an initiative called the Online Platform for Sustainable and Resilient Recovery from COVID-19, or “Platform for Redesign 2020.” Its website says it is a hub that collates countries’ climate and other environmental policies and actions that are planned and implemented in the context of recovery from COVID-19.\n\nGuterres noted that Japan’s advanced technology in many fields should make it a leader in shifting to renewable energy and urged it to stop financing construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe top priorities, he said, are prioritizing “green” jobs, ending subsidies for use of fossil fuels and taking energy and climate change issues into account in all decisions.\n\n“Clean energy delivers more jobs, cleaner air, better health and stronger economic growth,” Guterres said.\n\n“It makes no sense economically to burn money on coal plants that will soon become stranded assets,” he added. “There is simply no rational case for coal power in any investment plan.”\n\nJapan scaled back its ambitions for shifting to renewable energy after the massive March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown disasters in the northeastern Tohoku region led it to close down its nuclear power plants for safety overhauls.\n\nSome have restarted but most have not. In the meantime, the country has made up for lost power generating capacity by boosting use of coal, oil and gas, ramping up use of solar power and reducing waste.\n\nThe government also has sought to export its expertise and technology by helping to finance construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\nGuterres said the goals of halving global emissions by 2030 and achieving “carbon neutrality” by 2050 — key to limiting global warming — were achievable, “but we are currently off track.”He urged countries participating in the conference to come up with more ambitious plans and long-term strategies before COP26 next year.\n\nIn comments delivered on the website Platform for Redesign 2020, Japan’s environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, said the endeavor aims to help countries “redesign their economic and social systems in this time of dual crises.”\n\nThe pandemic has slowed most activities, he noted, but “climate change gives us no time to waste.”\n\n“Our task is not to return to the pre-pandemic world, but to build back better,” he said.",

But the companies are developing toolkits that are built around Bluetooth — the same technology used to connect phones to wireless earbuds or speakers.\n\nThe apps would be, in theory, an anonymous and secure record of people’s recent in-person encounters, so that if someone tests positive for the coronavirus, the apps can figure out who else among their close contacts may have been infected in the days before.\n\nWhen is this happening?\nThe U.S. will first need a robust testing system in place before it makes sense to deploy a smartphone app to trace people, researchers said. Tests are still in short supply, and a solution may still be weeks away.\n\nSometime in May, Google and Apple said they plan to build out their part of the effort, a set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, that will let the apps talk to phones and to other apps. APIs are a basic building block of modern software, and the idea is the apps will work on phones regardless of whether they use the Google Android or the Apple iOS operating systems.What info do these apps need?\nOut of privacy concerns, the apps would not need much personal information. Apple and Google said they don’t want to use GPS location data from the cellular network, though public health agencies might ask for that.\n\nThe apps are also voluntary, so people would need to choose to download the apps to participate, though the tech companies said they plan to add some of the functions in the phones’ basic operating systems.\n\nHow can Bluetooth track who’s nearby?\nBluetooth was standardized as a technology in the 1990s and named for a Viking king, Harald “Bluetooth” Gormsson. (The now-familiar logo is a combination of the king’s initials.)\n\nWhen Bluetooth is turned on, your phone uses radio waves to figure out which other devices are nearby. In this case, it would blast out an opaque string of characters called an identifier beacon — and other nearby phones would make a time-stamped log of that identifier.\n\nThe beacon would change every few minutes to prevent location tracking, and because it’s a random string of characters, the beacon would mean nothing to anyone even if they could see it.\n\nThe result is that, on each phone with the app, there would be something like an anonymous record going back 14 days of which other phones have been nearby and when.\n\nWhat happens to this log of contacts?\nThe data stays on the phone and doesn’t get sent to Apple, Google or the government, with one exception: if someone tests positive, they can choose to upload their phone’s log into the cloud, which is the group of computers running the system. Just what company or agency will run those servers is not yet clear.\n\nDepending on how the actual apps are built next month, someone will likely need approval from a health authority to do this. That would be to prevent a possible prankster from submitting an intentional false positive.\n\nBut even if you test positive and upload your data, the information would be meaningless to the companies or to the government. It would be a list of incomprehensible strings of numbers and letters, together with a timestamp.\n\nHow does this help anyone?\nUnder Google and Apple’s plan, your app would periodically download data associated with everyone who had tested positive in your region. On your phone, the app would search your log of identifier beacons, comparing them with those of positive test cases.If there’s a match, you would get a notification on your phone — meaning that someone you’ve spent time with recently tested positive. You would not know who it was.\n\nPrivacy would be built into it, according to the plan outlined by the companies. All the matching takes place on your phone, not on a central server, and the servers don’t even know whose phones are getting alerts.\n\nThe notification would have information on what to do next: perhaps get tested and self-isolate.\n\nWhat about people I pass on the street?\nThat wouldn’t be long enough to create a log on your phone. The person and their phone would need to be nearby for at least five minutes, and maybe longer depending on how the apps are developed.\n\nHow close you’d need to be is a trickier question. The distance that Bluetooth radio waves can travel varies widely, and objects like walls or windows cause them to deteriorate, the industry says. Even humidity in the air can make a difference.\n\nWill the apps Apple and Google help build track my location?\nThis question is also tricky. Apple and Google are building out this technology based on Bluetooth proximity data, not location associated with cellular signals. So, the answer initially seemed to be no.\n\nBut the companies aren’t building the actual apps. Public health authorities or maybe other companies are doing that. And there’s a chance they will add additional layers and features on top of what Apple and Google are providing and supporting. None of these apps has been released yet, so we can’t examine them yet.\n\nOf course, many smartphone apps already track location data, and it’s important for users to know how their location privacy settings work.\n\nAre enough people going to use this?\nThat’s not clear. Getting people to download an app may prove difficult, even if mayors and governors urge them to do so. The effort has received an official nod of approval from California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThen again, people might jump at it if it means returning to something close to normal life. Or maybe office buildings or grocery stores will require you to have it before you can enter.\n\nAnd eventually, Google and Apple plan to give people a strong nudge. They said that “in the coming months,” they would build contact tracing notifications into the Android and iOS operating systems, pushing out a system that might be slightly more difficult to opt out of.\n\nWithout the possible help from a smartphone app, contact tracing is a labor-intensive process. Localities such as San Francisco are planning to hire dozens of people who would conduct interviews with coronavirus patients about their recent contacts.",

    "content": "Multiple people were killed in a major crash involving a tour bus on its way to Ohio from New Jersey and three semi-trucks on the Pennsylvania Turnpike early Sunday in the western part of the state that left dozens injured, according to officials.\n\nThe \"extremely serious\" crash happened around 3:40 a.m. Sunday in the highway's westbound lanes in Mount Pleasant Township, located about 40 miles southeast of downtown Pittsburgh, according to Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Stephen Limani.\n\nLimani said there were five fatalities and about 60 injuries as a result of the crash. Of those injured -- ranging in age from 7 to \"into their 60's\" -- two are listed in critical condition, according to Limani.\n\nNJ TRANSIT TRAIN SLAMS INTO CAR ON TRACKS SOUTHWEST OF NEWARK, KILLING DRIVER AND PASSENGER\n\nPennsylvania State Police said the tour bus was traveling westbound on the highway from Rockaway, New Jersey to Cincinnati on a downhill curve when it struck an embankment and rolled over. After the bus rolled over, it was then struck by two semi-trucks before a third truck collided with the two other semis involved in the initial crash. Another vehicle then also became ensnared in the crash site.\n\nA total of six vehicles were involved in the crash, including a tour bus, three semi-trucks loaded with parcels and one private passenger vehicle, according to police.State police said that a total of 39 people were transported to area hospitals, including 28 sent to Frick Hospital in Mount Pleasant and 11 transported to Forbes Hospital in Monroeville.\n\nImages from the scene showed mangled wreckage on the highway. A tour bus could be seen flipped on its side as a result of the crash.Angela Maynard, a tractor-trailer driver from Kentucky, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review she was traveling eastbound with her co-driver on the turnpike around 3:30 a.m. when they came across the crash.\n\n“It was horrible,” she said.\n\nMaynard told the newspaper she saw someone on the ground, while another person was trapped in their truck.\n\nSUV DRIVES OFF CALIFORNIA CLIFF – BUT NEITHER VEHICLE NOR OCCUPANTS HAS BEEN FOUND, AUTHORITIES SAY\n\n“I walked toward the scene and saw one of the truck drivers laying [sic] near the barrier. I tried to keep him occupied, keep talking, until medical help arrived,\" Maynard told the Tribune-Review. \"He was in bad shape. He was floating in and out of consciousness.”\n\nThe bus, part of Z&D Tours, was filled with passengers mostly from other countries, according to Limani. He said two \"most prominent\" languages were Japanese or Spanish, but officials are still working on identifying those who were killed or injured due to many having documents and identification that are still at the crash scene.\n\n\"It's just a lot going on when it comes to identifying them and contacting their loved ones,\" he told reporters at a news conference Sunday afternoon.Limani said the Red Cross is assisting the victims of the crash, and \"doing everything\" to make it as comfortable as it can be to those impacted by the incident.\n\nThe crash caused all lanes to be closed in both directions on the highway between the Breezewood and New Stanton exits, roughly an 86-mile stretch of roadway.\n\nMotorists traveling east are being urged to use Route 119 south US 40 east to Interstate 68 east (at Cumberland, Maryland) to Interstate 70 west and re-enter the turnpike at the Breezewood Interchange exit 161.Westbound motorists are urged to use Route 30 west to Interstate 99 north to US Route 22 west to Route 66 south and re-enter the turnpike at exit 75 in at the New Stanton exit, according to KDKA-TV.It was not clear if the weather was a factor in the crash. The National Weather Service forecast for Westmoreland County early Sunday listed light unknown precipitation and an air temperature just below freezing.\n\n\"The one thing about traveling through Pennsylvania is that we have change in weather. It could be just because of our mountains, our hills. Just the way that our elevation changes,\" Limani told reporters. \"We were told that by some of the people that were driving, that the weather did start to change.\"\n\nLimani told reporters that weather conditions \"could have played a factor\" in the crash, but authorities will be able to \"get to that answer\" as the investigation progresses.\n\nPennsylvania Turnpike Chief Operating Officer Craig Shuey told reporters at a news conference Sunday afternoon that work crews had been treating the roadway since 9 p.m. due to wintry conditions in the region. Shey added that road crews were cycling treatment using either salt or cinders during the time period before the crash took place.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has dispatched a board member and team of 13 people to the scene, according to Limani\n\nOne FedEx semi-truck was pictured among the trucks involved in the crash. In a statement to Fox News, a FedEx spokesperson said the company extends \"our deepest condolences to the families of the individuals involved in this accident.\"\n\n\"There is no higher priority for FedEx Ground than safety, and we are cooperating fully with investigating authorities at this time,\" the spokesperson added.",

    "content": "Mumbai Indians 149 for 8 (Pollard 41*, Chahar 3-26) beat Chennai Super Kings 148 for 7 (Watson 80, Bumrah 2-14) by one run\n\nIn a deeply tactical and wildly chaotic final, Lasith Malinga turned around a horror night in an exceptional final over to hand Mumbai Indians their fourth IPL title.\n\nThe match went this way and that - both batting sides arguably underperformed, technology gave the third umpire a nightmare, catches went down and run-outs were missed - before it came down to Chennai Super Kings needing nine to win off the final over. Malinga - three overs for 42 until then, a dropped catch, ordinary fielding and a missed run-out to his name - turned up one final time with creaky joints to concede just seven. With two required off the last ball, he bowled the most magical slower-ball to win it for Mumbai when most bowlers would have been happy to bowl a slower wide ball to try to ensure the tie first.\n\nOn a night when experience came to the fore, Shane Watson nearly enjoyed a similar fairy-tale. Trusted through what can conventionally be seen as a horror run, Watson carried Super Kings in the final with 80 off 59, twice undoing Mumbai's good work with his targeted assault of Mumbai bowlers, but his physical struggles got the better of him in the last over. With five required off three balls and with Malinga nailing his yorkers, Watson set off for a suicidal second, not only running himself out but also leaving Ravindra Jadeja stranded at the non-striker's end. It was perhaps time for Jadeja to say no to that second.\n\nIf Chahar doesn't get you, Thakur will\n\nWinning the toss and deciding to bat because of the pressure of the final, Mumbai came out full of intent to not let Super Kings bowl Deepak Chahar for three straight overs in the Powerplay. Quinton de Kock went after Deepak in the third over, hitting him for three sixes, and MS Dhoni was forced to go to Shardul Thakur in the fifth over. De Kock hit him for a six fourth ball of the over. Now Mumbai were close to pushing Deepak and Super Kings out of their comfort zone; all they needed was to not lose a wicket in the next two balls.\n\nDe Kock didn't pay much mind to this by-play, and went for another six, gloving the ball to Dhoni. This allowed Deepak to come back in the sixth over, and he responded beautifully with a knuckle ball that got the wicket of Rohit Sharma for 15. What's more, he made that sixth over - usually the most difficult in the Powerplay - a maiden. From 45 for 0 in 4.4, Mumbai went to 45 for 2 at the end of the Powerplay.\n\nDhoni teams up with dataWell he might not have, but he did exactly what a data analyst might have asked him to do. He usually reserves Dwayne Bravo for the death, and bowls Harbhajan Singh and Imran Tahir through the middle. In this game, Bravo's match-up against Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard was not suitable for Super Kings so Dhoni bowled two of his overs by the 10th over. You could excuse de Kock for not being aware of the by-play, but Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan were clearly guilty of letting Super Kings play the game they wanted to. They just played out three overs without much intent, dawdling to 58 for 2 in nine overs on a pitch that could not be termed slow.\n\nCat and mouse continues\n\nThe tactical contest continued with Tahir getting Suryakumar in his first over - the 12th - and Mumbai delaying the introduction of Hardik and Pollard. Out came Krunal Pandya, and Thakur came back to get him. Soon Tahir had Kishan for the fifth time in five innings they have come up against each other. It was now down to Pollard and Hardik against Super Kings' death bowlers.\n\nPollard overcomes\n\nDhoni's tactics continued to test Mumbai. He had picked six bowlers just for this reason: he wanted options if it got chaotic. Now he refused to give Bravo to Pollard and Hardik. Instead, Deepak and Thakur bowled. Even though Thakur went for 16 in the 18th over, Deepak pulled things back with a four-run 19th over that also got him two wickets. Despite a 20-run over, he ended with 26 runs in his four overs. Hardik out of the way, Dhoni finally went to Bravo, who managed to get under Pollard's skin thanks to pin-point field sets and a couple of lenient calls on the wide. Pollard, though, managed to get better of the frustration by hitting the last two balls for fours.\n\nWatson, du Plessis put Mumbai under pressure\n\nMumbai, too, had bowling options at their disposal, but they were put under pressure. Faf du Plessis went after Krunal, whose match-up against Watson was favourable for Mumbai. Watson in response took apart Malinga. Krunal, though, got du Plessis stumped with a wide delivery. However, at 53 for 1 at the end of the Powerplay, Super Kings were favourites.\n\nRaina gets stuckSuresh Raina, Super Kings' second-biggest draw over the years, then got stuck against the bowling of Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Rahul Chahar. He seemed helpless against the short ball bowled to a specific plan. He survived what everybody thought was a straightforward catch to the wicketkeeper, only for technology to disagree, but by the time he fell lbw to Rahul, Super Kings had let Mumbai claw their way back in.\n\nRohit immediately went to Bumrah, asking for a wicket, which was delivered. Dhoni seemed set to set this up for a late finish, but he was run out in a freakish manner, trying to take an overthrow and found short by the slightest of margins. Third umpire Nigel Llong could have made either call and it would have found critics and supporters; he chose the red button. Super Kings now needed 68 off 44.\n\nWatson against Mumbai\n\nWith Bravo struggling against the bounce on the pitch, it was all down to Watson. At the start of the 16th over, Rohit had two overs each from Bumrah and Malinga. It looked like a straightforward call to bowl them from 16 through to 19, but something about Malinga had been off all night. It showed in the 16th over as Watson hit him for three straight fours to bring it down to 42 off four overs. Bumrah was there to pull it back with a sensational 17th that went for just four.\n\nMalinga was struggling physically. He had to be given a break. It was between the Pandya brothers now. Rohit went for the spinner presumably because he had great numbers against Watson. However, these match-ups become null and void once the batsman is set. Watson showed that majestically by hitting three consecutive sixes. Bumrah again dragged Mumbai back, and despite a misfield to give them four byes off the last ball of the 19th over, Bumrah had kept them alive.\n\nHad to be Malinga\n\nThere was no way anybody other than Malinga was going to bowl this last over. His experience had to be relied upon. First ball: yorker nailed from round the wicket to Watson. Now eight off five. Second ball, low full toss, should have been run out, concedes a single. Now seven off four. Third ball: another yorker from round the wicket, this time hit wide of long-on for an easy two. Now five off three. Fourth ball: wide yorker, Watson takes the risk and de Kock makes up with a smart collection and flick back onto the stumps. Now four off two.\n\nTo the new batsman, Malinga continues with the round-the-wicket angle, but Thakur gets enough bat on the low full toss to get two. With two required off the last ball, long chats follow. De Kock removes one glove. Seemingly many plans are formed and discarded. Finally we have a field that seems set for a slower ball outside off, but Malinga delivers with the beguiling dipping slower ball that traps Thakur right in front. Pollard carried him on his shoulders. The baddest daddy in town had beaten Dad's Army.",

    "content": "Can a couscous curb abstention? An association in Tunisia believes that it can. Tunisia Youth Impact is using cooking contests to encourage young Tunisian women in rural villages to go to the ballot box and vote in the country’s presidential election. \n\nADVERTISING\nIt is Saturday, October 12, in the small rural town of Echamine, around 20km south of Tunis. The next day, the country will vote in the second round of a presidential election pitting Nabil Karoui against Kais Saied in a head-to-head runoff.\n\nBut the chances are that here and in towns like it across the country, not everyone – in fact fewer than half of voters – will be heading to the ballot box. In the first round, the national turnout was just 48.98%.\n\nTunisia Youth Impact is hoping to change that, all through the power of gastronomy. Its Voticook cooking contests, in which participants vote for the winner, aims to raise awareness among rural populations, and particularly women, of the importance of participating in the democratic process.\n\nPractice vote\n\n“It’s a practice vote,” explains Wafa Tarhouni, president of the association. “It’s a competition between a certainnumber of women who compete through their dishes to be elected by the diners at the meal.”\n\nFrom electoral lists to voting booths and sealed ballot boxes, the volunteers from Tunisia Youth Impact strive to match as closely as possible real-life voting conditions. The only difference is that the ink into which voters in Tunisia are normally required to dip their fingers to show they have cast their ballot has been replaced by a mixture of water and shampoo.\n\nIn Echamine, the day’s contest is being held in the concrete courtyard of a two-story house, still only half-built. It is the home of mother-of-four Hinda Jlass who, surrounded by her children and with a smile on her face, is preparing her own couscous for the competition.\n\n“This event is above all a way of getting together with other women, and the essential thing is to participate,” she says.\n\nParticipating is something the 50-year-old housewife also plans to do on Sunday when she will cast her ballot in the second round of the presidential election. It will be only the second time she has voted in her life.At noon, Jlass is joined by the other competitors from the village, seven in all. These are the candidates. But rather than a political programme they will be presenting their best culinary creations to the electors – in this case a group of around fifty people.\n\nEU observers\n\nEach competitor will get a chance to say a few words about their dish – mainly couscous but also plates of macaroni and a rice dish, all accompanied by traditional mechouia salads and honey-flavoured makroudh pastries.\n\nThe “electors” will taste each concoction before voting for their favourite, using the exact same procedure they will use to cast their ballot in the presidential election the next day. Tunisia Youth Impact volunteers will be on hand to guide them through the voting process and make sure no one misses a step that might invalidate their vote.\n\nAdding to the realism is the presence of members of the ISIE, the Tunisian election authority, and Stefan Ziegler, a European Union election observer.“It’s original and everyone seems to be having fun,” Ziegler says with a smile. “It can only be a good thing for Tunisian democracy.”\n\nAfter the vote, the ballots are counted. It is another opportunity for volunteers to point out the mistakes that might lead to a vote being declared invalid: a signature instead of a cross next to the chosen candidate, for example.\n\nA clear winner soon emerges: Najwa Jlass, the sister of the hostess.\n\n“I’m of course very happy to have won,” she says, clearly a little moved. “But what makes me happier is to see our community come together like this.” She adds that she will be going to vote “for real” the next day.",

    "content": "The Bank of England (BoE) had a difficult 2016, marked by severe political turbulence and ongoing weakness in the European and global economies. In particular, the UK's referendum on European Union membership resulted in the central bank needing to navigate a policy and communications minefield. Debate around the implications of the UK voting to withdraw from the EU ('Brexit') began early in 2016, and as the bank warned of the potential shock to the economy, it was accused of becoming embroiled in politics and \"talking Britain down\". The BoE found itself in the group of the institutions reviled as 'experts' by certain members of the Brexit camp. Then came the shock. The UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, UK prime minister David Cameron resigned the following day, when the result was revealed, and power struggles broke out in the UK's two leading political parties. It soon became clear that the government and the civil service had no contingency plan for Brexit. Against this backdrop, the BoE executed a textbook example of crisis communications. It put out a short statement at around 7am UK time stating the BoE was \"monitoring developments closely\", had \"undertaken extensive contingency planning\", was \"working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks\", and would \"take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability\". BoE governor Mark Carney then delivered an address to camera just before 9am, elaborating to a limited extent on some of the details provided in the statement. He highlighted the strength of UK financial institutions, saying the capital requirements of the UK's largest banks \"are now 10 times higher than before the crisis\" and the BoE has \"stress-tested them against scenarios more severe\" than the country currently faced. He added that UK banks had raised more than \"£130 billion [or $175 billion using June 24 exchange rates] of capital\" and had \"more than £600 billion of high-quality liquid assets\". Carney highlighted that the BoE could provide \"more than £250 billion of additional funds\" through its normal liquidity facilities and could \"provide substantial liquidity in foreign currency, if required\". Amid a backdrop of sterling falling to a 30-year low against the US dollar and a $2 trillion sell-off in equities around the world, the BoE's action reassured market participants, including some of the world's largest investors in gilts, and drew praise from its former grandees. Officials at the Bank for International Settlements' annual meeting that weekend, who had expressed astonishment at the result of the vote, said early signs were that markets had functioned roughly as they ought to have done, even if the moves were violent.\nInitially, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its fire, choosing not to adjust monetary policy on July 14 by an eight-to-one vote. But in early August, the BoE acted. The MPC not only cut its policy rate to 0.25%, it also unveiled £60 billion in additional UK government bond purchases and the option to buy \"up to\" £10 billion in corporate bonds. It created a new £100 billion 'term funding scheme', designed to encourage banks to extend credit, and its financial policy committee amended the leverage ratio to exclude central bank reserves from the exposure measure. The move was unusual, as it appeared the BoE was deploying monetary, liquidity and macro-prudential policies in an attempt to address political uncertainties related to the future of the UK's trading relations with the EU. With hindsight, these actions also appeared overdone. But given the lack of Brexit planning by the UK government, real concerns about UK economic growth and a pervading mood of uncertainty, officials at the BoE felt they had little choice but to act. As BoE chief economist Andrew Haldane said in late July, he would rather \"run the risk of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut\" than taking \"a miniature rock hammer to tunnel my way out of prison\".\nInstitutional introspection While the BoE's Brexit response is open to criticism, there seems to be little doubt that the central bank's aim was to act in a responsible manner. \"The Old Lady has been a reassuringly calm and professional presence throughout a tumultuous 2016,\" says Martin Ellison, a professor of economics at the University of Oxford. Moreover, it is the BoE's work across an array of less headline-grabbing topics that really underscores its achievement during the past year. The financial stability arm of the bank has maintained its scrutiny, tightened standards and redesigned its stress-testing framework. More planks of the UK's post-crisis capital regime have been slotted into place. Reforms have continued to financial benchmarks and the operation of key markets, while a new team has developed a framework for testing banks' cyber defences. The BoE's overhaul of its real-time gross settlement system is also well under way, as is work on more esoteric areas of banking technology, such as distributed ledgers. The UK central bank issued the first of its new polymer banknotes – a 'fiver' bearing the image of Winston Churchill. And new communication and transparency initiatives continue to be rolled out. Ground-breaking research has continued, including the study of big data, agent-based modelling, network theory and other less-trodden areas of economics. Laying the foundations The manner in which business has continued as usual, despite the stormy political backdrop, highlights a deep-rooted commitment to implement best practice and plan ahead. Indeed, the process of reform at the BoE traces back many years. Four major external reviews between 2012 and 2014 – of forecasting, transparency, emergency liquidity and day-to-day liquidity – have opened the BoE up to scrutiny of a kind few central banks face. Kevin Warsh, a former US Federal Reserve governor, was asked by Carney to conduct a review of transparency around the BoE's MPC meetings. He reported back in 2014, recommending some major changes, including the publication of transcripts of the last day of MPC meetings (with an eight-year lag) and the creation of what are now dubbed 'Super Thursdays' – the simultaneous release of policy decisions, minutes and inflation reports. The BoE adopted Warsh's recommendations in full between 2015 and 2016. No bank has been more open-minded, more willing to take constructive input than the Bank of England. The bank is unafraid to evaluate novel reform ideas to help achieve their objectives. And they adopt these reforms with great speed and resolve Kevin Warsh, former US Federal Reserve governor Warsh tells CentralBanking.com that such an attitude to scrutiny and criticism is quite remarkable. \"I've spent a lot of time hanging around central banks,\" says Warsh. \"No bank has been more open-minded, more willing to take constructive input than the BoE. The bank is unafraid to evaluate novel reform ideas to help achieve their objectives. And they adopt these reforms with great speed and resolve.\" David Stockton, a former head of research at the Fed, who conducted the review of forecasting in 2012, also says the BoE was open and honest during the process: \"The bank really took on board the challenges I identified. That was not just the senior management, but also at the staff level. I thought their response was both positive and constructive.\" Refining 'transparency' \"One subtle point often gets lost,\" says Warsh. \"We talk about transparency as if 'more' is always and everywhere better. In my review, the bank pursued two objectives: one is transparency; but the other is getting the right answer. What the bank did is ask: 'How we can pursue both these objectives?'\" Officials at the BoE recognise this distinction – not only is it reflected in the Warsh review's balance between accountability and candid debate, but also in the bank's broad efforts to get its message across. The BoE's head of stakeholder communications is also responsible for the central bank's broader strategy – an indication of how closely the two areas knit together. While its press office tends to err towards a more control-centric approach (taking advantage of the BoE's monopoly position) when dealing with the official media, communications more broadly at the BoE have developed in recent years. The central bank is now working to embed communications throughout the policy process, so it is considered at every stage, not just tacked on at the end. The team is focused on tailoring its message. One example is the inflation report, which is being reworked into layers – simple clear messages at the top, but additional detail and complexity for those interested in digging.\nThe bank has also strengthened its presence on social media, although it recognises a social media strategy has to be carefully shaped to send the right message and reach the right people. The team is trialling methods such as sentiment analysis to inform its approach, as well as surveying users and running polls to gauge people's understanding and trust in the institution. Better communication with the general public and regional stakeholders is also a goal. Carney signalled this by making his first speech in Nottingham, rather than London. More recently, 'Open Forum' days attracted a much wider audience than most other BoE events and the central bank has launched its 'KnowledgeBank' website, designed to offer concise and clear explanations of its work. Another important pillar is the bank's research, which also ties into communication. The BoE now runs an economics blog to let its economists test ideas in a less formal setting, and the renamed 'Staff Working Paper' series is meant to show that researchers are welcome to pursue ideas that might deviate from the house view. Chief economist Haldane often gives speeches in which he raises unorthodox ideas, and recently caused a stir by saying economic forecasting had gone badly awry in 2008. Oxford University's Ellison welcomes this approach: \"I don't necessarily agree with everything Andy says, but it is refreshing to see the chief economist of the BoE engage with the big issues in such an open manner.\" Forecasting troubles The BoE has strong institutional foundations, built up over many years and strengthened under both Carney and his predecessor, Mervyn King. But strong foundations can be undermined, and an example often cited is the BoE's work around Brexit, where its short-term forecasts were off course. In August, the BoE predicted a sharp slowdown of growth and a relatively smooth increase in inflation to around 2%. Inflation actually rose rapidly, and is now expected to peak at close to 3% this year. Meanwhile, the UK economy was the strongest growing of the Group of Seven in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. Growth even increased slightly after the Brexit vote. Many critics, however, still treat central bank forecasts as if they are useless whenever they fail to predict the future with pinpoint accuracy. \"MPC members never believed that any of the models the bank had were telling them precisely what would happen,\" says David Miles, who sat on the MPC from 2009 to 2015. \"Although you read in the press that it all went terribly wrong and the bank has had to completely rethink how it does things, that's largely a myth.\" Stockton, who used to be responsible for the US Federal Open Market Committee's forecasts, makes a similar point. Forecasts are there to help policymakers understand the \"full range\" of what might happen so they can position policy accordingly, Stockton tells CentralBanking.com: \"You want to judge a central bank's forecast not just on its root-mean-squared error, but whether that forecast was making policymakers better aware of the risks.\" They [the Bank of England] were right, in my opinion, to warn of the risks before the referendum, and their actions helped to calm down nerves once the vote had taken place Panicos Demetriades, former governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus Furthermore, faced with nervousness in markets, political uncertainty as a new government formed, and the threat of worse shocks to come, launching a powerful programme of easing had a significant calming effect. Some actions require 'shock and awe'. \"They were right, in my opinion, to warn of the risks before the referendum, and their actions helped to calm down nerves once the vote had taken place, although what they did in terms of the announcement carried its own risks,\" says Panicos Demetriades, a former governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and professor of economics at the University of Leicester. Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian raised a related idea in remarks at the UK's Houses of Parliament late in 2016: \"After the outcome [of the vote], there was a real risk of a shock to the payment and settlement system... You have got to guarantee the system, and that is what the BoE did. It came out and said: 'I am here – I will basically do whatever it takes.' ... I think that was very important for confidence.\" Coping with critics Critics may be right that Carney stressed the risks more than he ought to have done during the Brexit debate. But given the political flux, calls for his resignation by some Eurosceptic politicians were overdone. And when new Conservative prime minister Theresa May signalled she was planning to effect a \"change\" to monetary policy, triggering speculation that the BoE's independence was under threat, Carney forcefully stood his ground. \"We at the BoE have long said monetary policy has been overburdened, and that we need a better balance between monetary, fiscal and structural policy,\" Carney told attendees at the IMF/World Bank annual autumn meeting in Washington, DC. Ellison says the BoE has been \"quite successful\" in defending its position, such that \"its independence is much less under threat than in the heady days immediately after the referendum result\". Ultimately, on October 31, Carney secured a one-year extension to his contract, taking it to 2019, once more defying the BoE's statutes, but effectively ending speculation about his future. Importantly, Carney's high-profile engagement enabled much of the rest of the BoE's work to continue largely uninterrupted. There is still more work to do. The process of reform and adaptation is ongoing, with an open debate on the correct form that accountability should take, as raised in a paper last year by Harvard economists Ed Balls, James Howat and Anna Stansbury. The authors distinguish between 'operational' and 'political' independence, arguing that sacrificing some of the latter would significantly improve accountability and have little impact on policy outcomes. Although he thinks there is unfinished business, Balls – formerly the UK shadow chancellor – praises the BoE's recent work. He tells CentralBanking.com: \"The BoE, and governor Mark Carney, have done a very good job in very difficult economic and political circumstances over the past six months.\"\nIf you would like to purchase additional rights please email info@centralbanking.com",

    "content": "The social uprising in Chile has now reached its fourth month. Masses of people continue to protest and demand structural change despite ferocious repression—mainly at the hands of the militarized Carabineros police force—which has revived traumatic memories. Now, Chileans are looking ahead to a plebiscite that may open the way to a new Constitution. The dictatorship-era charter has been a major obstacle to change over the past three decades. Redrafting the constitution is a key demand in Chileans’ sweeping rebuke of the status quo.  \n\nGeneral Augusto Pinochet’s 1980 Constitution both symbolizes and imposes the authoritarian model at the root of the ongoing mobilization. The Constitution institutionalized the economic and political domination of the dictatorship and enshrined a neoliberal framework that erased the role of the state in social and economic areas. It restricted political participation, gave the Right disproportionate power, and installed a tutelary role for the armed forces. And it continues to straightjacket the Chilean system. I, among others, analyzed such regimes in the 1990s—I termed them “guardian systems.”\n\nDespite 30 years of post-dictatorship elected rule and some reforms to the 1980 Constitution, the market model embodied in Pinochet’s charter still shapes economics and politics in the country. Pinochet’s radical neoliberal transformation privatized the pension system and promoted the development of a private sector in the health and education fields. These privatizations have perpetuated inequality and reinforced extreme social divisions. Moreover, Chile is the only country in the world with almost completely privatized water—Chapter III, Clause 24 of the 1980 Constitution establishes the “right” to private ownership of water. Drought paired with the corporate monopolization of water resources concessioned to the mining and agriculture industries have caused multiple communities, small farms, and cities in various parts of the country to run dry in the past year. The Constitution locked in these “guardian structures” by imposing strict rules for constitutional amendments, requiring supermajorities in Congress.\n\nChile’s elected governments have not reformed or democratized the Carabineros since the dictatorship, and the militarized police continue to treat the Chilean people as “the internal enemy.” Shortly after the protests began in October, president Sebastián Piñera, a right-wing billionaire, declared while surrounded by military officers: “We are at war.” He called thousands of army troops to patrol the streets for the first time since the dictatorship, to enforce a 10-day curfew, evoking memories of Pinochet’s terror. Piñera’s government, whose support has vacillated between 4 to 7 percent in 2020, has used repression to sow fear, intimidate, and attempt to divide protesters. But outrage over the October crackdown only spurred more massive demonstrations. On October 25, 1.2 million chilenos gathered to protest in Santiago’s Plaza Italia. “¡Chile despertó!” they chanted. “Chile woke up.”\n\nSince then, several international human rights delegations have criticized the security forces, denouncing the deliberate intent to inflict harm on the protesters rather than disperse them. In November 2019, Human Rights Watch noted “compelling evidence of excessive use of force and abuses against demonstrators and bystanders.” Chileans are struggling against the repression of the state as well as the unjust economic system. They are demanding rights for the people as opposed to private profit-making.\n\nInequality in Chile\n\nThe October protests put Chile’s entrenched inequality in the spotlight. A 2019 study by The Lancet showed that a woman in a poor district of Santiago lives some 18 years less than a woman in a rich neighborhood in the same city. Chile’s income inequality gap is more than 65 percent wider than the OECD average, and it has one of the highest ratios between the average income of the wealthiest and poorest 10 percent of the population, according to a 2018 report. The neoliberal gutting of public services has fueled rampant inequality. The country has two health systems: an excellent private system for those who can pay First World fees, and a severely underfunded public system serving some 80 percent of Chileans. Wait times in public hospitals can last for years and there are insufficient supplies. Almost 10,000 persons died in the first half of 2018 while waiting for an operation or treatment in the public system.\n\nThe privatized pension system, which has produced a bonanza of wealth for its investors, pays a pittance to elderly people who worked their whole lives. According to a 2015 report by La Comisión Asesora Presidencial sobre el Sistema de Pensiones, 80 percent of retirees receive less than the minimum wage of $414 per month in pensions. The educational system reproduces class divisions, as youths from the upper classes easily enter prestigious universities, while those from modest backgrounds come from substandard schools. University education—considered a market commodity and not a right or a public good—is expensive, and families go into debt for years to pay. Salaries are low and the cost of living continues to increase. The metro fare hike that sparked the social uprising in October was the last straw. As the protesters chanted, “It’s not 30 pesos, it’s 30 years!”\n\nChile’s Social Rebellion\n\nWhile continuing Chile’s rich history of popular resistance, the demonstrations since October also mark a new era of social struggle defined by broad-based participation, youth involvement, and new forms and symbols of autonomous mobilization. “María,” (not her real name), who has attended all the Friday protests as well as others, explained that since October, the Carabineros, with their tanks and squadrons, have blocked the avenues where people have traditionally marched. María, a young professional and social science graduate, pointed out that that the strategy produces large concentrations of people in the plazas. The primera linea—youths who wear bandanas and carry homemade shields—ring the crowd to protect them from bullets, gas canisters, and advances by the Carabineros. Meanwhile, popular symbols have changed. In large demonstrations in the past, people carried the banners of their political parties or social organizations. Such banners are gone in the protests today, reflecting the spontaneous nature of the social explosion and its distance from the political parties. Today people carry Chilean flags, Mapuche flags, or black flags condemning state violence. More surprising are the banners denoting allegiance to particular fútbol teams, such as Colo-Colo, which is something new. The protests grow in size whenever there is a new outrage.Chileans are demanding an end to socioeconomic and political exclusion. Some 70 to 80 percent are in favor of a new Constitution—forged under democracy—to guarantee social rights. Chileans now look forward to the national plebiscite called for April 26 to vote for a path toward a Constitution that will protect the rights to education, health, and decent pensions, among others. The Piñera government initially resisted the idea of a plebiscite, but reluctantly acquiesced after political parties in Congress signed an agreement in November 2019 to move toward a solution to the massive unrest.\n\nThe plebiscite will ask voters two questions: whether or not they want a new Constitution, and whether they want the constitutional convention that would draft it to be made up of citizens or a mixed body of citizens and legislators. The convention would draft a new Constitution to be ratified in another national plebiscite.\n\nThe constituent process had to be approved by Congress and parliamentarians have a key role in legislating the mechanisms needed for the constitutional process. The Left has pushed for the constituent convention to have gender parity and to reserve seats for independent social activists, not only political party members, as well as Mapuche representatives, but these measures have not yet succeeded in Congress. In the Senate, 3/5 approval was necessary to approve gender parity; although outvoted, the right-wing minority had enough votes in January to block the measure. The extreme Right is already lobbying against the new Constitution. In particular, members of the Unión Demócrata Independiente (UDI), founded by Pinochet functionaries, prefer authoritarian options to preserve their wealth and power. Some sectors of the extreme Right want to annul the plebiscite entirely, arguing that there is too much violence for the process to take place.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has made its position clear. On December 16, when a television journalist asked whether he would contemplate a new model as people were demanding, Piñera— a key proponent of Trump’s campaign to oust Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro—retorted: “If you speak of a change in the model you’re thinking of Venezuela!” On February 2, the minister of education, Marcela Cubillos, declared that she was not “neutral” on the constitutional process, stating that “the government represents a project of society whose fundamental values are expressed in the current Constitution.” Cubillos, a UDI member, is known for her repressive reactions to protests, her intransigence, and her hostile attitude toward educational reform. Her father was a navy officer, an organizer of the 1973 coup, and Pinochet’s minister of foreign relations for two years.\n\nCarabinero Repression\n\nThe casualties suffered by the social movement have been the worst since the dictatorship. The Carabineros use aggressive and unprovoked violence against demonstrators and onlookers, deploying tanks to spew toxic gases in large crowds and shooting tear gas canisters and rifles directly at protesters. Piñera has praised the force, while its commander, General Rozas, has stayed in the shadows. Indeed, the government has refused to remove him, despite repeated requests by political party leaders and social activists. Five human rights reports—authored by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), among others—have denounced the brutal and indiscriminate violence of the militarized police. Some 36 people have died, though exact tolls vary. The OHCHR reported that 28,000 people were jailed between October 18 and December 6, many arbitrarily. In a January 31 report, the Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos (INDH) noted that 427 persons had suffered mutilations of their eyes due to state violence. Some people have completely lost one or both eyes.Rights groups have documented how the Carabineros have aimed teargas canisters and rifles at people’s heads, against their own protocols. Police rifles were supposedly equipped with rubber bullets, but the University of Chile discovered police were firing shotgun pellets, with only a small proportion of rubber. The OHCHR, in its December 2019 report, decried “torture, ill-treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence” against those detained by the Carabineros and denounced the “unnecessary and disproportionate use of less-lethal weapons, in particular anti-riot shotguns, during peaceful demonstrations and/or outside the context of violent confrontations between demonstrators and security forces.” Videos circulated on social media show the Carabineros have used their vehicles to hit and crush people. They also have attacked medics, press people, and human rights observers with clearly marked signs and uniforms.On January 28, as fans were leaving a stadium in Santiago after a soccer game, a Carabinero truck traveling at high velocity hit a fan named Jorge Mora and kept driving. The incident was caught on video and went viral on social media, provoking enormous protests. Mora died before reaching the hospital. The same night, Piñera, said in an event, “When the Carabineros go out on the street they do so to protect public order.” The Carabinero driving the truck was detained, but the next day a court freed him and told him to sign in once a week at the police station. This ruling provoked even more outrage.\n\nHundreds of beatings of civilians, especially by groups of Carabineros, have been concentrated in Santiago Centro and in Puente Alto, singling out this working-class barrio in the southern part of the city. The INDH documented a total of 697 cases of squads of state agents attacking and beating lone civilians between the start of the uprising and January 31, including 123 incidents involving Carabineros, nine involving military men, and seven involving the investigative police. One notorious incident took place on January 29, when, after a protest over Jorge Mora’s death, seven or eight Carabineros attacked and savagely beat an18-year-old named Matías Soto. They left the youth on the sidewalk, with multiple fractures, jumped back into their van, and drove off. A security camera captured the entire assault. The INDH filed a lawsuit for torture in this case.\n\nIn addition to the police brutality, beloved symbols of popular culture have also suffered damage. The tomb of New Song folksinger Víctor Jara, who was tortured and murdered in 1973, was vandalized on January 18. The Víctor Jara Foundation organized a ceremony to clean and beautify the tomb, gathering musicians and the general public in the cemetery to dispel the aura of hatred. The Centro Arte Alameda, an arts center dating from 1992 near Plaza Italia, was burned and heavily damaged due to a fire in December. The center had provided space to medical personnel and people wounded in the demonstrations. While the fire is still under investigation, witnesses said Carabinero canisters started the blaze and videos seemed to verify that. On February 7, the Violeta Parra Museum, dedicated to the national artist and singer-songwriter, was burned after the Carabineros fired at least six flaming tear gas canisters at the building. Videos posted on Twitter as well as eyewitnesses documented this case.\n\nThe Protests Continue \n\nDespite the repression, Chileans continue to demonstrate almost every day, and large protests continue each Friday in Plaza Italia, popularly renamed Plaza de la Dignidad. The Carabineros mobilize in force on Fridays, and incidents invariably occur. The composition of the crowds has changed since the early days, when hundreds of thousands of people of all ages went to the plaza. Today, most of the demonstrators are young. They don gasmasks and bandanas, and some have begun fighting back when cornered by Carabineros. Some Carabineros have been injured, although statistics vary widely.\n\nThe Chilean people are determined, they are creative, and they are resilient. Protesters have worked with firefighters to put out fires started by tear gas canisters. Thousands of fans at soccer games have held up huge banners, denouncing the repression and chanting against Piñera. Bike riders have staged mass group rides to protest. People chant against the government in traditional festivals and carnivals. Popular musicians have played in large concerts and benefits to help victims of the violence, especially those who have lost eyes. Hundreds of women have performed the spoken feminist anthem “El violador eres tú” by Las Tésis, which has also been replicated around the world in different languages. Singers such as Nano Stern and Ana Tijoux have written songs about the rebellion and the state’s violence, while people continue to sing other songs, including the iconic, politically conscious music of Víctor Jara and Los Prisioneros. National poet Raúl Zurita wrote an anguished poem called “Venceremos” about the hundreds of eye injuries, which captures the solidarity of the Chileans with the words:\n\nAnd we will embrace each other weeping\n\nAnd we will embrace each other singing\n\nAnd my eyes will be your eyes\n\nAnd all Chile will be your eyes…\n\nPopular street murals, along with graffiti, cover the walls of central Santiago, and makeshift memorials and flowers mark the places where people died. Protesters carry a giant plaster statue of the “revolutionary dog” El Negro Matapacos—a street dog who accompanied students during the 2011 protests, and other later ones—along with other puppets, and some demonstrators dress as aliens or cartoon characters such as Pikachu.Piñera has made small concessions but has resisted any structural change to the neoliberal model. His response to social demands has been repression rather than dialogue. Piñera and his allies have pushed to enact a “security agenda” which has had some success in Congress. In January, Congress passed an “anti-looting law” that criminalized various protest tactics such as building barricades, blocking traffic, and wearing bandanas. The law is now in effect. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights had expressed alarm in a letter to Congress, stating: “Some of the legislative initiatives risk harming the exercise of a series of human rights, particularly…freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of expression…”\n\nThe Plebiscite and the Future of Chile\n\nWill the people of Chile be able to shape their own destiny via a plebiscite? Two months before the scheduled vote, the answer remains uncertain. Approval ratings of Chile’s institutions, including the Congress and the president’s office, rank at an all-time low in surveys. María, the protester, expressed her greatest hope for this process: “We want an end to this neoliberal system with its injustices and its inequalities, so people can live with more fairness and more dignity,” she said. “We want to end the Constitution of Pinochet and to move toward a state with social justice.” Her greatest fear? “That nothing will change.”\n\nThe month of March will be definitive in this struggle. Schools begin again and Chileans return to daily life. Chileans are very clear that they want a new political and socioeconomic model that assures their rights. Their struggle to transform the state has implications for all of Latin America, and indeed, for the world. Chile represents the hope that “people power” can overcome extreme versions of neoliberalism and restricted forms of politics to achieve new, more democratic systems of governance.",

    "content": "(CNN)Japan's Emperor Naruhito has officially proclaimed his enthronement, in a ritual-bound, centuries-old ceremony attended by more than a hundred dignitaries from around the world.\n\nThe head of state began his reign in May, after his father, Akihito, became the first emperor to abdicate in 200 years. But on Tuesday, Naruhito, 59, announced his change in status to the world, in an elaborate series of rituals known as \"Sokui no Rei\" at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.As the ceremony began, purple curtains were pulled back to reveal Naruhito and his wife, Empress Masako, 55, sitting in two ornately decorated thrones.Naruhito wore a rust-colored robe -- just as his father did during his own enthronement in 1990 -- while Masako wore a patterned, white robe and topped her traditional hairstyle with a gilded headpiece. The brother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito, 83-year-old Prince Hitachi, watched the proceedings from a wheelchair.\nReading from a large piece of paper, Naruhito then proclaimed his enthronement before an audience of the imperial family.\"I pledge hereby that I shall act according to the Constitution and fulfill my responsibility as the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people of Japan, while always wishing for the happiness of the people and the peace of the world, turning my thoughts to the people and standing by them,\" Naruhito said.\n\"I sincerely hope that our country, through our people's wisdom and unceasing efforts, achieves further development and contributes to the friendship and peace of the international community and the welfare and prosperity of humankind.\"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stood before Naruhito's throne, and read a speech. He then bowed deeply and yelled \"Long live the emperor!\"\nAs Naruhito ascended the throne, boxes were placed next to him that are believed to contain a sword and ancient jewel that, according to legend, date back to the mythical forefather of Japan's first emperor, Jimmu, who ruled almost 2,700 years ago. Along with a fabled octagonal mirror, they form Japan's royal regalia, or the Three Sacred Treasures. The sword and the jewel are so sacred that they've never been seen in public.\nNaruhito will also receive felicitations from local -- and international -- representatives. Earlier in the day, Naruhito donned a white robe to pray at Shinto shrines in the Imperial palace.A number of high-profile guests were in attendance, including Britain's Prince Charles and embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon was also on the guest list, despite an ongoing trade spat between South Korea and Japan.\nThe enthronement ceremony will be followed by an imperial banquet on Tuesday night.Celebrations tempered\nThe high-profile occasion comes as Japan reels from Typhoon Hagibis -- one of the strongest storms to hit the country in years. The typhoon left dozens dead and caused extensive damage after it smashed into the country earlier this month.\nThe devastation prompted the palace to postpone a 4.6-kilometer (2.9-mile) public parade from the Imperial Palace to Akasaka Palace until November.\nOn Friday, the government announced that about 550,000 petty criminals will be pardoned to mark the emperor's enthronement.Chrysanthemum traditions\nNaruhito -- whose name means \"a man who will acquire heavenly virtues\" -- became the 126th Emperor of Japan in May, the latest in an unbroken line that stretches back 14 centuries.\nIn this handout image provided by Imperial Household Agency, New Japanese Emperor Naruhito delivers his first speech after ascending the throne during the enthronement ceremony at the Imperial Palace on May 1, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan.\nNaruhito's ascension signaled the start of the \"Reiwa\" era. Each emperor's reign is marked by their era name, Naruhito's era name was adapted from an 8th century anthology of classic poetry and means \"beautiful harmony.\"\nThe role of Japan's emperor has changed significantly since Naruhito's grandfather, Emperor Hirohito, sat on the throne. Once considered the living embodiment of gods, the emperor has become a largely symbolic figure.\nUnlike other monarchs, Naruhito is a symbol of the state rather than the head of state, and the Japanese emperor wields no political power.\nNaruhito took the throne after his father, Akihito, became the first emperor to abdicate the Chrysanthemum Throne in modern history. In addition to being the first in centuries to abdicate, Akihito was the first Japanese Emperor to marry a non-royal speak to his subjects live on television and to be hands-on in raising his children.\nNaruhito, who became the first Japanese royal to study abroad, has pledged to continue his father's legacy and work to break down the barriers between the emperor and his subjects.\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correctly identify the brother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito.",

    "content": "China has successfully put another probe on the Moon.\n\nIts robotic Chang'e-5 mission touched down a short while ago with the aim of collecting samples of rock and dust to bring back to Earth.\n\nThe venture has targeted Mons Rümker, a high volcanic complex in a nearside region known as Oceanus Procellarum.\n\nThe lander is expected to spend the next couple of days examining its surroundings and gathering up surface materials.\n\nIt has a number of instruments to facilitate this, including a camera, spectrometer, radar, a scoop and a drill.\n\nThe intention is to package about 2kg of \"soil\", or regolith, to send up to an orbiting vehicle that can then transport the samples to Earth.\n\nIt's 44 years since this was last achieved. That was the Soviet Luna 24 mission, which picked up just under 200g.Unlike the launch of the mission a week ago, the landing was not covered live by Chinese TV channels.\n\nOnly after the touchdown was confirmed did they break into their programming to relay the news.\n\nImages taken on the descent were quickly released with the final frame showing one of the probe's legs casting a shadow on to the dusty lunar surface.\n\nThe US space agency congratulated China. Nasa's top science official, Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, said he hoped the international research community would eventually get the chance to analyse any samples sent home.\n\n\"When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe 8.2-tonne Chang'e-5 spacecraft \"stack\" was launched from the Wenchang spaceport in southern China on 24 November (local time). It arrived above the Moon at the weekend and then set about circularising its orbit before splitting in two.\n\nOne half - a service vehicle and return module - stayed in orbit, while a lander-ascender segment was prepared for a touchdown attempt.\n\nThe Chinese space agency said this lander-ascender element put down at 15:11 GMT (23:11 China Standard Time). The precise position was reported as 51.8 degrees West longitude and 43.1 degrees North latitude.\n\nChang'e-5's success follows China's two previous Moon landings - those of Chang'e-3 in 2013 and Chang'e-4 last year. Both of these earlier missions incorporated a static lander and small rover.\n\nA total of just under 400kg of rock and soil were retrieved by American Apollo astronauts and the Soviets' robotic Luna programme - the vast majority of these materials coming back with the crewed missions.\n\nBut all these samples were very old - more than three billion years in age. The Mons Rümker materials, on the other hand, promise to be no more than 1.2 or 1.3 billion years old. And this should provide additional insights on the geological history of the Moon.\n\nThe samples will also allow scientists to more precisely calibrate the \"chronometer\" they use to age surfaces on the inner Solar System planets.\n\nThis is done by counting craters (the more craters, the older the surface), but it depends on having some definitive dating at a number of locations, and the Apollo and Soviet samples were key to this. Chang'e-5 would offer a further data point.Reports from China suggest the effort to retrieve surface samples may last no longer than a couple of days. Any retrieved materials will be blasted back into orbit on the ascent portion of the landing mechanism, and then transferred across to the service vehicle and placed in the return module.\n\nThe orbiter will shepherd the return module to the Earth's vicinity, jettisoning it to make an atmospheric entry and landing in the Siziwang Banner grasslands of the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. This is where China's astronauts also return to Earth.\n\n\"Chang'e-5 is a very complex mission,\" commented Dr James Carpenter, exploration science coordinator for human and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency.\n\n\"I think it's extremely impressive what they're trying to do. And what I think is fascinating is you see this very systematic, step by step approach to increasing their exploration capabilities - from the early Chang'e missions to this latest one.\"",

    "content": "The Bank of England (BoE) had a difficult 2016, marked by severe political turbulence and ongoing weakness in the European and global economies. In particular, the UK's referendum on European Union membership resulted in the central bank needing to navigate a policy and communications minefield. Debate around the implications of the UK voting to withdraw from the EU ('Brexit') began early in 2016, and as the bank warned of the potential shock to the economy, it was accused of becoming embroiled in politics and \"talking Britain down\". The BoE found itself in the group of the institutions reviled as 'experts' by certain members of the Brexit camp. Then came the shock. The UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, UK prime minister David Cameron resigned the following day, when the result was revealed, and power struggles broke out in the UK's two leading political parties. It soon became clear that the government and the civil service had no contingency plan for Brexit. Against this backdrop, the BoE executed a textbook example of crisis communications. It put out a short statement at around 7am UK time stating the BoE was \"monitoring developments closely\", had \"undertaken extensive contingency planning\", was \"working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks\", and would \"take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability\". BoE governor Mark Carney then delivered an address to camera just before 9am, elaborating to a limited extent on some of the details provided in the statement. He highlighted the strength of UK financial institutions, saying the capital requirements of the UK's largest banks \"are now 10 times higher than before the crisis\" and the BoE has \"stress-tested them against scenarios more severe\" than the country currently faced. He added that UK banks had raised more than \"£130 billion [or $175 billion using June 24 exchange rates] of capital\" and had \"more than £600 billion of high-quality liquid assets\". Carney highlighted that the BoE could provide \"more than £250 billion of additional funds\" through its normal liquidity facilities and could \"provide substantial liquidity in foreign currency, if required\". Amid a backdrop of sterling falling to a 30-year low against the US dollar and a $2 trillion sell-off in equities around the world, the BoE's action reassured market participants, including some of the world's largest investors in gilts, and drew praise from its former grandees. Officials at the Bank for International Settlements' annual meeting that weekend, who had expressed astonishment at the result of the vote, said early signs were that markets had functioned roughly as they ought to have done, even if the moves were violent.\nInitially, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its fire, choosing not to adjust monetary policy on July 14 by an eight-to-one vote. But in early August, the BoE acted. The MPC not only cut its policy rate to 0.25%, it also unveiled £60 billion in additional UK government bond purchases and the option to buy \"up to\" £10 billion in corporate bonds. It created a new £100 billion 'term funding scheme', designed to encourage banks to extend credit, and its financial policy committee amended the leverage ratio to exclude central bank reserves from the exposure measure. The move was unusual, as it appeared the BoE was deploying monetary, liquidity and macro-prudential policies in an attempt to address political uncertainties related to the future of the UK's trading relations with the EU. With hindsight, these actions also appeared overdone. But given the lack of Brexit planning by the UK government, real concerns about UK economic growth and a pervading mood of uncertainty, officials at the BoE felt they had little choice but to act. As BoE chief economist Andrew Haldane said in late July, he would rather \"run the risk of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut\" than taking \"a miniature rock hammer to tunnel my way out of prison\".\nInstitutional introspection While the BoE's Brexit response is open to criticism, there seems to be little doubt that the central bank's aim was to act in a responsible manner. \"The Old Lady has been a reassuringly calm and professional presence throughout a tumultuous 2016,\" says Martin Ellison, a professor of economics at the University of Oxford. Moreover, it is the BoE's work across an array of less headline-grabbing topics that really underscores its achievement during the past year. The financial stability arm of the bank has maintained its scrutiny, tightened standards and redesigned its stress-testing framework. More planks of the UK's post-crisis capital regime have been slotted into place. Reforms have continued to financial benchmarks and the operation of key markets, while a new team has developed a framework for testing banks' cyber defences. The BoE's overhaul of its real-time gross settlement system is also well under way, as is work on more esoteric areas of banking technology, such as distributed ledgers. The UK central bank issued the first of its new polymer banknotes – a 'fiver' bearing the image of Winston Churchill. And new communication and transparency initiatives continue to be rolled out. Ground-breaking research has continued, including the study of big data, agent-based modelling, network theory and other less-trodden areas of economics. Laying the foundations The manner in which business has continued as usual, despite the stormy political backdrop, highlights a deep-rooted commitment to implement best practice and plan ahead. Indeed, the process of reform at the BoE traces back many years. Four major external reviews between 2012 and 2014 – of forecasting, transparency, emergency liquidity and day-to-day liquidity – have opened the BoE up to scrutiny of a kind few central banks face. Kevin Warsh, a former US Federal Reserve governor, was asked by Carney to conduct a review of transparency around the BoE's MPC meetings. He reported back in 2014, recommending some major changes, including the publication of transcripts of the last day of MPC meetings (with an eight-year lag) and the creation of what are now dubbed 'Super Thursdays' – the simultaneous release of policy decisions, minutes and inflation reports. The BoE adopted Warsh's recommendations in full between 2015 and 2016. No bank has been more open-minded, more willing to take constructive input than the Bank of England. The bank is unafraid to evaluate novel reform ideas to help achieve their objectives. And they adopt these reforms with great speed and resolve Kevin Warsh, former US Federal Reserve governor Warsh tells CentralBanking.com that such an attitude to scrutiny and criticism is quite remarkable. \"I've spent a lot of time hanging around central banks,\" says Warsh. \"No bank has been more open-minded, more willing to take constructive input than the BoE. The bank is unafraid to evaluate novel reform ideas to help achieve their objectives. And they adopt these reforms with great speed and resolve.\" David Stockton, a former head of research at the Fed, who conducted the review of forecasting in 2012, also says the BoE was open and honest during the process: \"The bank really took on board the challenges I identified. That was not just the senior management, but also at the staff level. I thought their response was both positive and constructive.\" Refining 'transparency' \"One subtle point often gets lost,\" says Warsh. \"We talk about transparency as if 'more' is always and everywhere better. In my review, the bank pursued two objectives: one is transparency; but the other is getting the right answer. What the bank did is ask: 'How we can pursue both these objectives?'\" Officials at the BoE recognise this distinction – not only is it reflected in the Warsh review's balance between accountability and candid debate, but also in the bank's broad efforts to get its message across. The BoE's head of stakeholder communications is also responsible for the central bank's broader strategy – an indication of how closely the two areas knit together. While its press office tends to err towards a more control-centric approach (taking advantage of the BoE's monopoly position) when dealing with the official media, communications more broadly at the BoE have developed in recent years. The central bank is now working to embed communications throughout the policy process, so it is considered at every stage, not just tacked on at the end. The team is focused on tailoring its message. One example is the inflation report, which is being reworked into layers – simple clear messages at the top, but additional detail and complexity for those interested in digging.\nThe bank has also strengthened its presence on social media, although it recognises a social media strategy has to be carefully shaped to send the right message and reach the right people. The team is trialling methods such as sentiment analysis to inform its approach, as well as surveying users and running polls to gauge people's understanding and trust in the institution. Better communication with the general public and regional stakeholders is also a goal. Carney signalled this by making his first speech in Nottingham, rather than London. More recently, 'Open Forum' days attracted a much wider audience than most other BoE events and the central bank has launched its 'KnowledgeBank' website, designed to offer concise and clear explanations of its work. Another important pillar is the bank's research, which also ties into communication. The BoE now runs an economics blog to let its economists test ideas in a less formal setting, and the renamed 'Staff Working Paper' series is meant to show that researchers are welcome to pursue ideas that might deviate from the house view. Chief economist Haldane often gives speeches in which he raises unorthodox ideas, and recently caused a stir by saying economic forecasting had gone badly awry in 2008. Oxford University's Ellison welcomes this approach: \"I don't necessarily agree with everything Andy says, but it is refreshing to see the chief economist of the BoE engage with the big issues in such an open manner.\" Forecasting troubles The BoE has strong institutional foundations, built up over many years and strengthened under both Carney and his predecessor, Mervyn King. But strong foundations can be undermined, and an example often cited is the BoE's work around Brexit, where its short-term forecasts were off course. In August, the BoE predicted a sharp slowdown of growth and a relatively smooth increase in inflation to around 2%. Inflation actually rose rapidly, and is now expected to peak at close to 3% this year. Meanwhile, the UK economy was the strongest growing of the Group of Seven in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. Growth even increased slightly after the Brexit vote. Many critics, however, still treat central bank forecasts as if they are useless whenever they fail to predict the future with pinpoint accuracy. \"MPC members never believed that any of the models the bank had were telling them precisely what would happen,\" says David Miles, who sat on the MPC from 2009 to 2015. \"Although you read in the press that it all went terribly wrong and the bank has had to completely rethink how it does things, that's largely a myth.\" Stockton, who used to be responsible for the US Federal Open Market Committee's forecasts, makes a similar point. Forecasts are there to help policymakers understand the \"full range\" of what might happen so they can position policy accordingly, Stockton tells CentralBanking.com: \"You want to judge a central bank's forecast not just on its root-mean-squared error, but whether that forecast was making policymakers better aware of the risks.\" They [the Bank of England] were right, in my opinion, to warn of the risks before the referendum, and their actions helped to calm down nerves once the vote had taken place Panicos Demetriades, former governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus Furthermore, faced with nervousness in markets, political uncertainty as a new government formed, and the threat of worse shocks to come, launching a powerful programme of easing had a significant calming effect. Some actions require 'shock and awe'. \"They were right, in my opinion, to warn of the risks before the referendum, and their actions helped to calm down nerves once the vote had taken place, although what they did in terms of the announcement carried its own risks,\" says Panicos Demetriades, a former governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and professor of economics at the University of Leicester. Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian raised a related idea in remarks at the UK's Houses of Parliament late in 2016: \"After the outcome [of the vote], there was a real risk of a shock to the payment and settlement system... You have got to guarantee the system, and that is what the BoE did. It came out and said: 'I am here – I will basically do whatever it takes.' ... I think that was very important for confidence.\" Coping with critics Critics may be right that Carney stressed the risks more than he ought to have done during the Brexit debate. But given the political flux, calls for his resignation by some Eurosceptic politicians were overdone. And when new Conservative prime minister Theresa May signalled she was planning to effect a \"change\" to monetary policy, triggering speculation that the BoE's independence was under threat, Carney forcefully stood his ground. \"We at the BoE have long said monetary policy has been overburdened, and that we need a better balance between monetary, fiscal and structural policy,\" Carney told attendees at the IMF/World Bank annual autumn meeting in Washington, DC. Ellison says the BoE has been \"quite successful\" in defending its position, such that \"its independence is much less under threat than in the heady days immediately after the referendum result\". Ultimately, on October 31, Carney secured a one-year extension to his contract, taking it to 2019, once more defying the BoE's statutes, but effectively ending speculation about his future. Importantly, Carney's high-profile engagement enabled much of the rest of the BoE's work to continue largely uninterrupted. There is still more work to do. The process of reform and adaptation is ongoing, with an open debate on the correct form that accountability should take, as raised in a paper last year by Harvard economists Ed Balls, James Howat and Anna Stansbury. The authors distinguish between 'operational' and 'political' independence, arguing that sacrificing some of the latter would significantly improve accountability and have little impact on policy outcomes. Although he thinks there is unfinished business, Balls – formerly the UK shadow chancellor – praises the BoE's recent work. He tells CentralBanking.com: \"The BoE, and governor Mark Carney, have done a very good job in very difficult economic and political circumstances over the past six months.\"\nIf you would like to purchase additional rights please email info@centralbanking.com",

    "content": "In early March, President Donald Trump said that restrictions he placed on travel to and from China “saved a lot of lives,” a claim that grew to “probably tens of thousands” and “hundreds of thousands” by early April. But we found no support for such figures.\n\nThe few studies that have been done estimate the U.S.’ and other countries’ travel restrictions regarding China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. We didn’t find a study that looked at the U.S. restrictions alone, and we found only one non-peer-reviewed study, on Australia, that found an impact of such policies on deaths, though it has significant limitations. \n\nPast studies, too, have found international travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.\n\nSaad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us he hasn’t seen any evidence to support the president’s claims. Previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the restrictions have to be very strict to have an effect, he said. Travel restrictions “can have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,” Omer said. But, “even then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn’t stop it.”\n\nOmer co-authored a Feb. 3 article on why a travel ban wouldn’t stop the coronavirus.\n\nAlex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, looked at several of the same studies we examined and concluded that “by themselves, travel restrictions do little but delay the onset of a crisis mentality and shift the curve to the right rather than flattening it.”As we have found with prior claims from the president, Trump’s assertions have progressively grown:Trump, March 5, Fox News town hall: But as soon as I heard that China had a problem, I said, “What’s going on with China? How many people are coming in?” … [Y]ou both know that I closed the borders very early. …. You know, it saved a lot of lives.\n\nTrump, March 17, coronavirus task force briefing: We closed it down to China, the source, very, very early. Very, very early. Far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. And I think, in the end, that’s going to be — that will have saved a tremendous number of lives.\n\nTrump, March 24, Fox News virtual town hall: I made a decision to close off to China. … Thousands and thousands of more people — probably tens of thousands would be dead right now if I didn’t make that decision.\n\nTrump, April 7, task force briefing: And I was called all sorts of names when I closed it down to China. …. If I didn’t do it — if I didn’t do that, we would’ve had hundreds of thousands more people dying.\n\nWe asked the White House for support for the president’s claims, specifically whether there was support for his claims of “tens of thousands” or “hundreds of thousands” of lives saved. We haven’t received a response.\n\nOn Jan. 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. As of that date, there were nine confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the U.S., though there had been very little testing. At that point, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not yet sent test kits to public health labs, so all testing was done through the CDC.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world. As of April 10, the U.S. had more than 486,000 cases and nearly 18,000 deaths, according to John Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\n\nUnder the travel restrictions, non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks.\n\nResearch on the Coronavirus Travel Restrictions\nAs we’ve written before, a study published in the journal Science on March 6 estimated that travel restrictions instituted in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and those put in place by several countries in early February regarding China would “only modestly” affect the spread of the pandemic.\n\nThe researchers — a team from the U.S., Italy and China, led by Northeastern University in Boston — used a model to estimate the impact. The model showed that a travel ban in Wuhan “was initially effective at reducing international case importations,” but “the number of cases observed outside Mainland China will resume its growth after 2-3 weeks from cases that originated elsewhere.” It found that restrictions by other countries would have “a modest effect” if they reduced travel to and from China by up to 90%, unless those restrictions were “paired with public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility.”\n\nIn other words, travel restrictions could delay, but not stop, the spread of the disease, and social distancing and hand-washing behaviors would reduce the transmission of the disease.\n\nAnother study published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences similarly found that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries “likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19.”\n\nThe researchers, mostly with the Yale School of Public Health, said that “rapid contact tracing” was “essential” to limit person-to-person spread.\n\nThe study did find that the travel lockdowns put in place in Wuhan and Hubei province lowered the daily rate of exportation of cases from China by 81.3% on average by Feb. 15. “At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response,” the study said.\n\nThe study also found that airport screening “has only a moderate benefit” early in the epidemic, as most people — 64% — travel during the incubation period, before exhibiting symptoms.\n\nThe study, which relied on data on the outbreak in China and airline network data to make its estimates, concluded that travel restriction measures are “unlikely to contain the outbreak,” but they could delay the importation of cases, providing time for unaffected areas to prepare a public health response.\n\nA third recent study, by researchers in China, the U.S. and the U.K., looked at both the travel restrictions and other emergency measures put in place in China only, estimating that shutting down Wuhan slowed the virus’ spread to other cities in China by 2.91 days.\n\nThe study, which was published in Science on March 31, concluded that the delay “provided extra time to prepare for the arrival of COVID-19 in more than 130 cities across China but would not have curbed transmission after infection had been exported to new locations from Wuhan.”\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has praised Trump’s travel restrictions on China, saying the U.S. has dealt with a lower number of cases because of the policies. At a press conference on Feb. 29, Fauci said, “If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.”\n\nThe studies we cited suggest that the travel restrictions could have slowed down, but not stopped, the importation of COVID-19 in the U.S. But when we looked into this issue in early March, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us there’s no evidence to show that and some reasons that it may not be the case — chiefly, the lack of testing, particularly early on. \n\n“[W]e weren’t seriously looking for cases in the US,” Nuzzo said.\n\nInitially, the CDC testing criteria focused on those with symptoms who also had been to Wuhan or in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. By late February, those criteria included anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced doctors could order tests if they thought one was needed. \n\nAlso, the U.S. restrictions were limited. In February, Nuzzo said, other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren’t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. “would likely not have picked it up” if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries were infected with the virus “because we weren’t using these other countries as criteria for testing,” she said.\n\nOmer, of the Yale Institute for Global Health, echoed that, saying, “People coming from Italy wouldn’t have been stopped,” whether they exhibited symptoms or not. (Trump’s restrictions on travel from Europe didn’t go into effect until March 13.)\n\nThe ability of the virus to elude limited travel restrictions raises questions about the one study we did find that estimates an impact on deaths. The study — which hasn’t been peer-reviewed — estimated Australia’s restrictions on travel from China will lower the potential number of deaths from COVID-19 in the country over the next year. However, it didn’t consider any impact of cases coming in from other countries, saying it “illustrates the principle of travel bans and public health impact on epidemic control using China as a case study.”\n\nThe study, posted without peer review on medRxiv on March 12, estimated the travel restrictions, implemented Feb. 1, would reduce the cases and deaths by 87% over 400 days. The case and death counts are relatively low in Australia: 6,215 cases and 54 deaths as of April 10, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.\n\nPast Studies Find Delay, Not Containment\nSeveral past studies have looked at the impact of travel restrictions on epidemics. They also have found some delay in the spread of the diseases, if the restrictions are significant, but not containment.\n\nA 2014 review of 23 studies on the impact of travel restrictions on the spread of influenza found overall they have “only limited effectiveness,” the degree of which varied depending on the restrictions themselves, epidemic size, transmissibility of the virus and other geographic considerations. The review, published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, said: “In isolation, travel restrictions might delay the spread and peak of pandemics by a few weeks or months but we found no evidence that they would contain influenza within a defined geographical area.”\nA 2011 study (included in the above review) on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic published in the journal PLOS One found that travel restrictions creating a 40% reduction in air traffic to and from Mexico, the origin of the influenza strain, caused a three-day or less delay, on average, in the first imported cases reaching other countries. It said that “no containment was achieved by such restrictions.” Even assuming an unlikely 90% air traffic reduction, the study said, “the resulting delay would be on the order of 2 weeks.”\nA 2012 study published in BMC Infectious Diseases by researchers in Hong Kong estimated that “imposing a 99% air travel restriction” would delay the peak of a new influenza pandemic in Hong Kong “by up to two weeks.” But, “[a]ntivirals and hospitalization were found to be more effective on attack rate reductions than travel restrictions,” the study said.\nIt’s possible that the U.S. travel restrictions on China could have had some impact in slowing the importation of cases to the U.S. But we don’t have evidence of that, or of what that impact is, let alone evidence that “hundreds of thousands” of lives were saved, as the president claimed.",

The aircraft was subsequently found on the ground about 0.8nm before runway 31 in soil and vegetation, near a soccer stadium and a cemetary, where the crew had attempted an emergency landing due to running out of fuel. Five occupants were killed, three occupants were taken to hospitals with injuries.\n\nUkraine's State Emergency Services (SES) reported the aircraft had disappeared from radar at 07:10L (04:10Z) about 13.7km (7.4nm) from the airport. At 07:29L one of the crew members called and reported the aircraft had attempted an emergency landing. At 07:40L the aircraft was located 1.5km (0.8nm) before the runway. By 09:00L it was determined tere were 8 people on board, 7 crew plus one cargo escort. Three bodies were found, three people were found with injuries and taken to a hospital, two people are missing. Rescue and Recovery operations are still in progress. The SES subsequently added, the two missing were found perished.\n\nUkraine's ministry of Infrastructure reported the aircraft was operated by 3 crew, 4 people were killed in the accident. The Ministry later added, that five people were found killed, three people needed to be extricated and were taken to a hospital. The aircraft carried 10 tons of cargo.\n\nThe Mayor of Lviv reported the crew had declared emergency due to being low on fuel but did not reach the runway anymore. The aircraft was found with the cockpit cut off, the cargo had shifted and crushed the occupants.\n\nUkaine's NBAAI reported the aircraft was scheduled to land in Lviv for a refueling stop. On approach to Lviv the crew performed an emergency landing which resulted in a rough landing and disaster about 1.5km before runway 31. Five of the eight people on board were killed. The NBAAI have opened an investigation.\n\nOn Oct 5th 2019 the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) revoked the status as authorized third country operator from the airline effectively disallowing the airline to operate within the airspace of the European Union.\n\nOn Oct 7th 2019 Ukraine's Ministry of Transport announced, the air operator's certificate (AoC) of the airline Ukraine Air Alliance was terminated effective Oct 5th 2019 00:00z. The Ministry wrote: \"The order was adopted on the basis of a decision of the Standing Commission on the Certification of Operators, Maintenance and Aviation Maintenance Organizations, Aviation Engineering Developers and Manufacturers, Training Flight Training Facilities in Ukraine, Flight and Technical Personnel (Minutes No. 46 of 04 October 2019 ).\"\n\nOn Oct 9th 2019 Ukraine's National Buereau of Air Accident Investigations (NBAAI) announced, that a special commission to investigate the aviation accident has been formed to determine the causes of the accident. The on site work of the commission took place between Oct 5th 2019 and Oct 7th 2019, the black boxes were recovered, found in satisfactory condition and have been read out. Information from ground based facilities like radar data, air traffic communication, weather information, emergency service response and ground based navigation aids at the aerodrome were collected. According to preliminary information the aircraft was scheduled to operate from Vigo (Spain) to Bursa (Turkey), a refueling stop was scheduled at Lviv. Of the eight crew members on board five were killed in the accident. According to the meteorological report at 03:40Z the flight was performed in difficult weather conditions, no wind at the airport, visibility near the ground was 250 meters with fog, RVR was 800 meters, vertical visibility was 60 meters, at an altitude of 600 meters the winds were blowing from 300 degrees at 6 meters/s (12 knots). The aircraft was heading at 310 degrees while on approach. The investigation is in progress.\n\nOn Dec 20th 2019 the NBAAI released their preliminary report.\n\nThe FDR and CVR were found in satisfactory condition and have been read out. The crew did not provide any \"critical remarks\" up to intercepting the localizer for runway 31. ATIS transmitted:\n\nLviv, ATIS “Romeo” for 03:20.

Confirm receipt of “Romeo” information.»\n\nThe NBAAI described the sequence of events during the final approach:\n\nAt 03:40:01, the crew reported the Runway-31 localizer beam capture.\n\nAt 03:40:27, the controller informed the crew of changes in the Runway-31 visibility range: at the touchdown point – 800 meters, in the middle of the runway – 800 meters, at the end of the runway – 750 meters, and vertical visibility – 60 meters.\n\nAt 03:41:47, the crew contacted the Tower controller and, after a few seconds, reported that it continued ILS approach to RW-31 and set QNH of 1013 hPa.\n\nAt 03:41:58, the controller informed the crew of wind nil on Runway-31 and cleared landing. The crew confirmed the landing clearance.\n\nAccording to ground-based recorders data, at this time, the aircraft speed was 316 km/h, the flight course was 310º.\n\nAccording to the flight recorders data, at the time of flight on final, starting from the distance of 6 km to the runway threshold, the aircraft descended significantly below the glide path, in particular, at the distance of 1.8 nm (about 3.3 km) from the touchdown point, the aircraft descended to the altitude of 100 meters and continued the flight almost one half as high as the glide path. At the altitude of 60 meters, an alarm sounded that the decision height had been reached, to which no crew member responded. At the distance of 1359 meters to the runway threshold, at the altitude of 5-7 meters, the aircraft collided with trees and impacted the ground. The Aircraft Wreckage Layout is presented in Figure 1.\n\nAt 03:43:37, the aircraft onboard transponder responded for the last time to the aerodrome surveillance radar.\n\nThe Alarm signal for Lviv aerodrome was announced by the Tower controller at 03:49:03.

It was sent to establish the technical condition of the engine.\n\nIn both the Ukrainian and the English version the preliminary report does not describe the condition of the propellers and whether they were turning (in flight attitude or feathered) at the time of contact with the trees or obstacles. The preliminary report also does not mention whether any fuel was recovered from the wreckage, whether any fuel odour could be noticed at the accident site, and does not provide any insight into the fuel management (e.g. how much fuel was on board on departure, and how much fuel should have been or was on board when the aircraft intercepted the localizer).\n\nOn Oct 8th 2021 the NBAAI released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:\n\nThe most probable cause of the accident, collision of a serviceable aircraft with the ground during the landing approach in a dense fog, was the crew’s failure to perform the flight in the instrument conditions due to the probable physical excessive fatigue, which led to an unconscious descent of the aircraft below the glide path and ground impact.\n\nContributing Factors\n\nProbable exceeding the aircraft takeoff weight during departure from the Vigo Airport, which could result in increase in consumption of the fuel, the remainder of which did not allow to perform the flight to the alternate Boryspil aerodrome.\n\nThe NBAAI reported all engines and propellers were servicable at the time of the accident, the engines did respond properly to crew inputs. The fuel system was servicable and supplied fuel as needed for takeoff mode at the time of accident until the aircraft came to a rest. No defects or technical malfunctions were found with the aircraft or any of its systems. During takeoff from Vigo the takeoff mass possibly exceeded the maximum takeoff mass by as much as 5400kg. The fuel remaining while on approach to Lviv did not permit to divert to Kiev Borispol. The crew departed from Vigo without necessary rest, the crew did not comply with the regulations regarding work hours and rest times.\n\nThe NBAAI reported there were 650kg of fuel remaining during the accident approach to Lviv. About 170 liters of fuel could be drained from the wing tanks of the wreckage, the wing tanks has not been damaged.\n\nThe NBAAI analysed:\n\nDue to the absence of the flight assignment, logbook, calculations of take-off weight and aircraft CG, performed by the crew before departure, the Investigation Team could not accurately establish the aircraft take-off weight and CG. But taking into account the information received from the Vigo airport about the commercial cargo weight, documents on the cargo, the amount of fuel filled, and information received from the cockpit crew communication, the Investigation Team calculated that the take-off weight of the aircraft during departure could make 66,400 kg.\n\nNote: according to the An-12BK Aircraft Flight Operation Manual, par 2.2, the maximum take-off weight shall be 61,000 kg.\n\nThe NBAAI analysed that the aircraft performance until climbing through 6600 meters suggested the aircraft was overloaded. The aircraft reached initial flight level FL240 96 minutes after departure and climbed to cruise FL250 another 86 minutes later.\n\nThe AAIB analysed the final approach:\n\nAt 03:22:25, the crew requested clearance from the controller of the Lviv ACC to descend to FL120, and, having received clearance at 03:22:40, began the descent and landing approach using the radar vectoring method as instructed by the controller.\n\nThere were no deviations in the operation of the engines based on the results of FDR decoding, and according to the crew reports based on the results of CVR decoding.\n\nAt 03:40:00 UTC, the height over the RW-31 threshold was 1170 m, descent rate -4 ... -4.5 m/s, flight speed 352 km/h, distance 15.70 km;\n\nAt 03:40:20 UTC, at a distance of 16.1 ... 14.7 km, the aircraft, in the process of descent, completes the turn and enters the final;\n\nAt 03:41:10 UTC, at a distance of 11 km, the aircraft is 70 m above the glide path. The estimated height of the point of entry into the glide path is 590 m, the actual height is 660 m. The indicated speed was recorded at 320 km/h. The vertical rate of descent was -6.5 m/s. The aircraft decreases and approaches the glide path;\n\nAt 03:40:01 UTC, the crew reported on the localizer capture beam for the ILS approach to Runway 31. The controller instructed to continue the ILS approach to Runway 31. The mean vertical descent rate was 4 ... 4.5 m/s.\n\nAt 03:40:30 UTC, the crew extended the landing gear at a distance of 13.9 km (according to recorders).\n\nNote: according to the Aircraft Flight Manual, the landing gear shall be extended before flaps are extended by 15º at a distance of at least 18 km. Thus, the crew released the landing gear with a 4 km delay.\n\nAt 03:41:16 UTC, at a distance of 11.6 km, the crew began to deploy the flaps to 15 degrees. The instrument speed was 326 km/h.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual, when approaching the landing, the flaps shall be deployed in three stages: at 15º, at 25º, at 35º. The maximum flight speed with flaps at 15º shall be 340 km/h. Thus, the flaps were extended at a lower speed than established by the Flight Operation Manual.\n\nAfter the flaps were deployed by 15 degrees, one of the crew members (flight engineer) reported of the aircraft configuration: \"15, landing gear extended, landing weight 53\".\n\nAt 03:41:36 UTC, at a distance of 10.64 km to the glide slope beacon, additionally flaps were extended by 20 degrees, the flight speed was 316 km/h.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual, the maximum flight speed with flaps extended at 25º shall be 340 km/h.\n\nAt 03:42:24 UTC, at a distance of 8.0 km from the glide slope beacon, the aircraft reaches the glide path. At a distance of 7.9 km, the aircraft crosses the glide path and continues to gradually descend below the glide path.\n\nAt that time, the internal engines were operating in the IKM2 – 10, IKM3 - 12 modes, the external engines were operating in the IKM1 – 19, IKM4 - 12 modes.\n\nNote: during the descent, it is necessary to balance the aircraft with the trims so that the aircraft steadily maintains the specified flight mode.\n\nIn the time interval 03:42:55 ... 03:43:00 at a distance of 4.7 ... 4.4 km, the crew extended the flaps to 35 degrees. The aircraft was below the glide path and continued to descend. 3-4 seconds after the flaps were extended, the thrust of the external engines increased and the vertical rate of descent began to increase.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual, flaps shall be extended to 35º before entrance to the glide path at a speed of 280-300 km/h. Thus, flaps at 35º were extended much later, when there were 4 km to the runway.\n\nAccording to the Flight Operation Manual, the extension of the flaps from 15º to 35º is accompanied by the aircraft's tendency to pitch up (an increase in the pitch angle) and a noticeable decrease in the gliding speed. Therefore, this desire should be countered by a smooth movement of the steering wheel away from a pilot and, if necessary, increase the engine thrust mode. Despite the fact that the plane was below the glide path, the situation became dangerous.\n\nAt 03:43:24 UTC, at a distance of 2.86 km from the runway threshold, the crew increased the thrust mode of the external engines to 42-43 by the engine torquemeter, while the vertical descent rate was 4-5 m/s, which exceeds the rate established for the Lviv aerodrome. The aircraft moved below the glide path by 65 m. The actual altitude was 105 m. After 7-8 seconds, the vertical descent rate increases again, the aircraft descended further below the glide path, the operating mode of the external engines increased to 55 by the engine torquemeter.\n\nAt 03:43:32 UTC, at an altitude of 60 m, at a distance of 1980 m from the runway threshold, the radio altimeter alarm “Decision Altitude” was triggered, but none of the crew members responded to it and the aircraft continued to descend.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual par 4.7.1, if a radio altimeter alarm is triggered to establish a reliable visual contact with the lights of the aerodrome lighting equipment or other landmarks along the landing course, an urgent go-around maneuver should be started.\n\nAt 03:43:34 UTC, at a distance of 1.67 km from the displaced threshold of the runway, the mode of the internal engines for a short time, for 3-4 seconds, increased and then decreased to 22-30, the vertical speed was 4 m/s, the height was 48 m (40m below the glide path), the speed was 244 km/h.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual Table 4.6, rate of descent with a landing weight of 50 - 55 t and flaps 35º should be 270 km/h. Thus, the crew did not control the speed and flew at a speed that was 26 km/h less than those established in the flight manual.\n\nAt an height of about 30 m over the runway threshold (20 m over the ground surface), 2-3 seconds before collision with trees, the elevator deviates to pitching-up by about 75% of the maximum value, but these actions were not enough to reduce the vertical speed and the aircraft continued descend with a vertical speed of 6 m/s and at a height of 5-7 m from the ground surface (15-17 m from the threshold of the runway) at a distance of 1500-1600 m from the threshold of the runway collided with trees. After a collision with trees, the recording on the recorder discontinued.\n\nDuring the flight along the glide path (navigator) provides commands to correct the direction of movement along the course, however, none of the crew members reported about the position of the aircraft relative to the glide path.\n\nDuring the flight along the glide path (navigator) reports the distance to the runway threshold (according to the extract of the crew's communication), which corresponds within an error of 150-200 m to the calculated distance according to the recorded coordinates of the aircraft.\n\nFrom an altitude of 100 m until the moment of collision with obstacles (flight engineer) reports the altitude by radio altimeters every 10 meters.\n\nAnalysis of the aircraft landing approach parameters at a distance of 11,000 meters, obtained from the recorders data, shows that the crew increased the instrument speed three times by increasing the vertical speed. So, at a distance of 8000 meters from the displaced threshold of the runway, the crew, after a slight loss of the indicated speed, increased the vertical speed to 6 m/s (established as 4 m/s), at a distance of 4200 meters from the displaced threshold of the runway, the crew, after losing the indicated speed, increased the vertical speed up to 5.5 m/s, with its subsequent decrease to 3 m/s, at a distance of 2000 meters from the displaced threshold of the runway and Habsolute=48 m, after the loss of the indicated speed to 237 km/h, the crew made a third attempt to increase the indicated speed for by increasing the vertical speed.\n\nThis approach procedure indicates inadequate actions of the PIC.\n\nWhen inspecting the accident site, the Investigation Team found devices of the aircraft instrument landing system, and found that the glide slope and heading alarm flags were turned off.",

It and other groups say they cannot enter Tigray to deliver aid, while refugees who have fled to Sudan are in urgent need of help.\n\nReuters was not immediately able to reach the TPLF for comment on Abiy’s remarks. Claims by all sides have been impossible to verify because phone and internet connections to the region are down and access to the area is tightly controlled.\n\n“The 72-hour period granted to the criminal TPLF clique to surrender peacefully is now over and our law enforcement campaign has reached its final stage,” Abiy tweeted, adding that civilians would be spared and thousands of fighters had already surrendered. The TPLF has denied its fighters are surrendering.\n\nBoth sides claim to have inflicted serious damage on the other, said Dino Mahtani, Deputy Director of the Africa Program at the International Crisis Group.\n\n“But federal forces appear closer to Mekelle amid reports of heavy combat between the two sides yesterday,” he said.\n\nAbiy’s office said authorities were distributing aid in areas controlled by the federal government in Tigray. Four camps for displaced persons were being established.\n\nA statement added: “This humanitarian assistance will now be further reinforced with the opening of a humanitarian access route to be managed under the auspices of the Ministry of Peace.”\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Ethiopia, Catherine Sozi, told Reuters she had no information on such an access route.\n\n\nNearly 43,000 Ethiopian refugees have fled to Sudan, but the numbers crossing have slowed from around 2,700 per day to just 700 on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to two humanitarian sources, refugees arriving in recent days said many were now being held back at the border. Two diplomatic sources said it was not immediately clear who was responsible for blocking them.\n\n“As far as we know, the border remains open,” Sozi said.\n\nAbiy says refugees are welcome to return. An aid worker at the Hamdayet crossing point in Sudan said Ethiopian soldiers could be seen on Wednesday “screaming” at refugees that it was safe to return.\n\nIslamic Relief said refugees could run out of food within days.\n\n“We are seeing many people with malnutrition, including pregnant women and malnourished new mothers who are trying to breastfeed their infants,” said Elsadig Elnour, Islamic Relief’s Country Director in Sudan.\n\nAbiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for ending a long-running stand-off with Eritrea, called on the people of Mekelle to “disarm, stay at home and stay away from military targets”.\n\nA diplomatic source said the TPLF “have mobilised lots of people in Mekelle. They are digging trenches and everyone has an AK47.”\n\nTigrayan forces have large stocks of military hardware and number up to 250,000 men, experts say.\n\nAfrican peace envoys sent to Ethiopia were expected to meet Abiy on Friday, two diplomatic sources said.\n\nThe conflict pits Ethiopia’s federal government against the TPLF, which dominated the country until Abiy took power two years ago.\n\nAbiy accuses Tigrayan leaders of starting hostilities by attacking federal troops. The Tigrayans, who make up about 6% of Ethiopia’s population, say his government has marginalised them.\n\nThousands of people are already thought to have died and there has been widespread destruction from aerial bombardment and ground fighting. TPLF rockets have hit the capital of neighbouring Eritrea.\n\nDaniel Bekele, head of the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, said “extreme caution to avoid civilian harm is of even greater importance, now, at this stage of the conflict”.",

    "content": "ALBANY, N.Y. (September 5, 2019) - The New York State Department of Health today announced new findings of its ongoing investigation into the vaping-associated pulmonary (lung-related) illnesses that have been reported across the state, including an updated case count and information regarding the testing being conducted at the Department's Wadsworth Center Laboratory.\n\n\"The cases of pulmonary illnesses associated with vaping are continuing to rise across New York State and the country,\" said Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker. \"We urge the public to be vigilant about any vaping products that they or any family members may be using and to immediately contact their health care provider if they develop any unusual symptoms. In general, vaping of unknown substances is dangerous, and we continue to explore all options to combat this public health issue.\"\n\nThe Department issued a health advisory in August, alerting health care providers of this emerging health threat and listing symptoms they should look for in patients. As of September 5, 2019, the Department has received 34 reports from New York State physicians of severe pulmonary illness among patients ranging from 15 to 46 years of age who were using at least one cannabis-containing vape product before they became ill. However, all patients reported recent use of various vape products.\n\nLaboratory test results showed very high levels of vitamin E acetate in nearly all cannabis-containing samples analyzed by the Wadsworth Center as part of this investigation. At least one vitamin E acetate containing vape product has been linked to each patient who submitted a product for testing. Vitamin E acetate is not an approved additive for New York State Medical Marijuana Program-authorized vape products and was not seen in the nicotine-based products that were tested.\n\nAs a result, vitamin E acetate is now a key focus of the Department's investigation of potential causes of vaping-associated pulmonary illnesses. Vitamin E acetate is a commonly available nutritional supplement that is not known to cause harm when ingested as a vitamin supplement or applied to the skin. However, the Department continues to investigate its health effects when inhaled because its oil-like properties could be associated with the observed symptoms.\n\nThe Wadsworth Center is testing both cannabis and nicotine-containing vape products as part of this investigation and continues testing the purity of New York's approved medical marijuana products. More than a dozen product samples, in some cases multiple samples from a single product, from patients reporting symptoms have been tested. These samples have been tested for a range of substances, including THC and other cannabis-derived cannabinoids, nicotine, synthetic cannabinoids, opioids and pesticides. Products tested include a variety of labels and packaging. Many are suspected to be counterfeits of recreational cannabis-containing vape products available in other states.\n\nPictures of some of the products that have been found to contain vitamin E acetate can be seen here.\n\nAnyone using vape products should never use unregulated products purchased \"off the street.\" Cannabis-containing products are not legally available in New York State for recreational use. These unregulated products are not tested and may contain harmful substances. Users of vape products should never modify vape products or add any substances to these products that are not intended by the manufacturer.\n\nThe Department of Health advises people who are not certified patients in the New York State Medical Marijuana Program to consider not using any vape products. E-cigarettes are not an FDA-approved smoking cessation product. Most adult smokers want to quit, and individuals who smoke or use other tobacco products can improve their chances of quitting for good with treatment from their health care provider and by using FDA-approved medications.To learn more, talk to your health care provider, or call or visit the New York State Smokers' Quitline at 1-866-NYQUITS.\n\nAnyone experiencing symptoms who uses vape products should contact their healthcare provider immediately.Healthcare providers should report possible cases to the local poison control center (1-800-222-1222). Patients using vape products reported a variety of symptoms, developing over a period of days to weeks, including:\n\nPulmonary symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, chest pain)\nGastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)\nFatigue\nFever\nHeadache\nWeight loss",

There was a failing,\" Mr Castaner told French news broadcaster France Inter.\n\nHe said investigators only learnt on Friday that in 2015 some of Harpon's colleagues had spoken about his praise for the jihadist attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Two gunmen killed 12 people there - an attack that Harpon reportedly described as \"well executed\".\n\nCharlie Hebdo lives on but 'in darkness'\nWhy known extremists can carry out terror attacks\nPolice colleagues had also commented on Harpon's changed behaviour towards women but, according to Paris police intelligence chief Françoise Bilancini, no concerns were formally reported.\"The alarm signals should have been enough to trigger an in-depth investigation, which is what we are doing now,\" Mr Castaner said. \"If a signal had appeared perhaps we could have prevented this happening.\"\n\nAbout 20 officers in the French security services have been taken off duty because of suspected Islamist radicalisation, he said, without giving details.\n\nMr Castaner brushed off calls for his resignation over the police \"failings\", saying he had not made any error in this case. But he pledged that \"we will tighten the net\" to pick up suspicious signs and rectify the \"malfunctioning\" alert system.Islamist background\nHarpon, a 45-year-old IT expert, had been working in the police intelligence unit since 2003. He had contact with members of the Salafist movement, anti-terrorist prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said, referring to the ultra-conservative Islamic ideology.\n\nOn Thursday morning, shortly before his attack, he exchanged 33 text messages with his wife. Mr Ricard said Harpon included religious phrases in his messages, such as \"Allahu akbar\" (God is greatest) and \"follow our much-loved Prophet Muhammad, and meditate on the Koran\".\n\nHis Moroccan-born wife was questioned by police but released from detention on Sunday evening. She reportedly told police that he had been incoherent and had heard voices the night before the attack.Anti-terror investigators took over the inquiry on Friday. It was initially regarded as a criminal matter.\n\nHarpon was shot dead on Thursday by a junior police officer after he attacked colleagues in several offices at the central police building.\n\nAccording to Mr Ricard, investigators established that Harpon left the building at lunchtime and bought two knives - one metal, the other ceramic - just half an hour before launching his attack.He stabbed three people inside two offices and two women on a stairway, before he was shot dead inside the building's courtyard. Three men and one woman were killed. A fifth person was seriously injured. Harpon slit the throat of one of the victims.\n\nThe police building is near major tourist sites including Notre-Dame Cathedral.",

He is alive, as long as piety, brightness, and humanity are living,\" he wrote, according to the English translation of the letter published by the semi-official Mehr news agency.\n\n\"He is alive, as long as nations are alive and struggle for consolidating independence, justice and kindness. I have no doubt that he will come back, and along with Christ the Saviour, the heir to all saintly and perfect men, and will bring peace, justice and perfection for all.\"\n\nThe president did not name Imam Mahdi, the revered saviour of Shia Islam, in his tribute, but by naming Christ he made clear that Chávez would also be among the Imam's allies. The reappearance of Mahdi is anticipated by believers in a manner comparable to that with which Christians anticipate the second coming of Jesus. Shia Muslims believe both will come on the resurrection day.\n\n\"Hugo Chávez was a name known to all nations. His name is reminiscent of pure innocence, kindness, fortitude and love for the people, to serve the people, especially the poor and the victims of colonialism and imperialism by arrogant powers,\" he wrote. \"He is indeed a martyr of the road to service to Venezuelan people, and preserving human and revolutionary values.\"\n\nOther religious figures in Iran have also echoed Khatami's criticism of Ahmadinejad's remarks about Chávez, one of his closest allies. Hossein Rouhaninejad of Iran's Islamic development organisation said the president's remarks were against Shia Islam beliefs. Another senior cleric, Seyed Mahdi Tabatabaei, chastised Ahmadinejad for \"wrong moves\", saying his comments were \"legally and religiously wrong\".",

    "content": "The European Cheops space telescope has launched to study planets outside our Solar System.\n\nThe observatory will follow up the discoveries of previous missions, endeavouring to reveal fresh insights on the nature of distant worlds: What are they made of? How did they form? And how have they changed through time?\n\nThe telescope was taken into orbit on a Russian Soyuz rocket that set off from French Guiana at 08:54 GMT.\n\nThe ride to 700km lasted 145 minutes.\n\nCheops (short for CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite) is a joint endeavour of 11 member states of the European Space Agency (Esa), with Switzerland in the lead.\n\nProf Didier Queloz, who won this year's Physics Nobel for discovering the first planet orbiting a Sun-like star in 1995, was on hand to watch the launch.\n\n\"I think it's great. We started this project more than 10 years ago and now that's it - we're in the sky,\" said the chair of the Cheops science team.\nWhat will Cheops do?\nThe University of Bern, together with the University of Geneva, has provided a powerful photometer for the telescope.\n\nThe instrument will measure the tiny changes in light when a world passes in front of its host star.\n\nThis event, referred to as a transit, will betray a precise diameter for the planet because the changes in light are proportional to the surface of the world. When that information is combined with data about the mass of the object - obtained through other means - it will be possible for scientists to deduce a density.\n\n\"From that we can say something about the planet's composition and internal structure,\" said Esa project scientist Dr Kate Isaak. \"And by measuring this for many different planets orbiting different types of stars, those close in and far out - we can also say something about the formation and evolution of planets,\" she told BBC News.\nWhat's significant about this mission?\nSome 4,500 planets have been discovered since the late 1990s using a variety of techniques. But there is a feeling now that the science has to move beyond just detection; beyond just counting planets. We need to profile the objects in a more sophisticated way. Do they have atmospheres and how thick are they? What kind of clouds? Do they possess oceans on their surface? Do they have rings and moons? Cheops ought to be able to address such questions just from looking for these tiny dips in light during a transit.\n\nThe mission has been given a list of 400-500 targets to look at over the next 3.5 years. Most of these worlds will be in the size range between Earth and Neptune, sometimes called \"super Earths\". From all the exoplanet surveys conducted to date, this grouping would seem to dominate the statistics.\nHow sensitive is Cheops?\nIt will be concentrating on bright stars, but even so - its observations will still be challenging.\n\nWhen a Jupiter-sized planet passes in front of a Sun-like star, the drop in light as viewed by Cheops will be as little as 1% of the total signal. If an Earth-sized planet does the same thing, the drop-off will be a hundred times smaller again, at 0.01%.\n\n\"The difficulty was in building an optical system that is capable of measuring these minute light changes,\" recalled Prof Willy Benz, the Cheops consortium principal investigator.\n\n\"To give you an example, when we wanted to test this in the lab we didn't find a single light source in the world that was stable to this precision to allow us to test our telescope - so we had to build one.\"\nHow does it fit with other missions?\nThe Americans are currently flying a space telescope called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), a follow-on to the highly successful Kepler observatory. Both are planet-finders and have had input into the candidates soon to be pursued by the 280kg Cheops observatory.\n\nThe Nasa ventures have, if you like, provided the shortlist for the European telescope. Its studies will now whittle the targets down still further to find the most promising subjects for the next generation of planet investigators. These missions will have the ability to analyse the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres, looking for gases that might hint at the presence of life. The most eagerly awaited is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) due for launch in 2021.\n\n\"It's very classic in astronomy that you use a small telescope 'to identify', and then a bigger telescope 'to understand' - and that's exactly the kind of process we plan to do,\" said Prof Queloz.\n\n\"Cheops will now pre-select the very best of the best candidates to apply to extraordinary equipment like very big telescopes on the ground and JWST. This is the chain we will operate.\"\n\nThe 30cm-aperture telescope was a secondary passenger on the Soyuz launch. The primary payload was an Italian radar satellite.\n\nCheops was released from the Soyuz' Fregat upper-stage at an altitude of 709km, moving at a speed of over 7.5km/s.\n\nOne of the early tasks for controllers, who are based in Spain, will be to open a protective door to the optics.\n\nDr Isaak said: \"The next few days are going to be very interesting. We're going to be working at the mission operations centre to check out the spacecraft. And then once that's done, everybody will have a very well deserved Christmas break. And we're back in the New Year to exercise the instrument, to check it's survived the launch, to see how it performs, and look to see then how we're going to process the data which is the end product that we're all very much looking forward to.\"\n\nScience operations will be run out of the University of Geneva.",

Unlike the menu, however, there are some quite unappetising items in its financials.Most off-putting of all, of course, is the enormous debt number. The interest on that £1.1bn is costing the company £93m a year, which wiped out all its operating profit last year - and then some.\n\nIn fact, the debt payments have pushed Pizza Express into the red for the last two years with a loss of £55m last year alone.\n\n'No imminent danger'\nThe frustrating thing for the business is that it is making a reasonable amount of cash. It's for that reason, its auditors were happy to conclude the chain is a viable going concern when it signed off its accounts in April this year despite the company's debts being worth more than its assets.To be clear, Pizza Express is not in imminent danger of going bust. It has until 2021 before it needs to start paying back £600m to its outside creditors. (The other £500m is a loan from its Chinese owners).\n\nBut debt is a serial company killer - just ask Carillion or Thomas Cook. It can suffocate a company, so the earlier you try and address the issue the better.\n\nBonds in Pizza Express are selling for 84p for every £1 worth of loan. That means that investors do not think those lenders will get all their money back.\n\nThe casual dining sector is littered with names which have been through some sort of insolvency process. Prezzo, Byron, Carluccio's needed to close stores and ask creditors to agree to rent reductions, while Jamie's Italian went bust.\n\nIf Pizza Express is going to last another 50 years some sort of debt restructuring looks inevitable.

The economy will shrink by nearly 6 percent this year, they expect, but add that the Netherlands is better off than many other European countries, NOS reports.\n\nThe worst shock to the economy is already behind the Netherlands. This happened in the second quarter, when all kinds of sectors were forced to closed. Between March and early June, Rabobank expects the economy shrunk by 8 percent. The catering industry in particular was hit hard. \"Restaurants and cafes are allowed to open again, causing the catering industry to pick up somewhat from the deep valley of the second quarter,\" Ester Barendregt of Rabobank said to NOS. \"But for the year as a whole, a contraction of 41 percent remains for this sector.\"\n\n-ADVERTENTIE-\nOther sectors are still awaiting their toughest period. \"For example, the biggest blow to industry is likely to come in the third quarter,\" Barendregt said. \"Construction got off to a very strong start this year, but will now also be delayed by the corona crisis and the long-standing nitrogen problems.\" Like the sector itself, the bank expects shrinkage in construction to continue into 2021.\n\nUnemployment will continue to rise. At the start of this year, 284 thousand Netherlands residents were unemployed, an unemployment rate of 3 percent. Rabobank expects this to rise to 7 percent by the end of this year. In the coming months, more and more self-employed and freelancers will be without work. There will also be more reorganizations and bankruptcies, resulting in employees with permanent contracts losing their jobs.Companies are also faced with consumers who have less to spend. The outlook for exports deteriorated. And many of the Netherlands' major trading partners were also hit hard by the pandemic. Dutch companies will therefore export 7.2 percent less goods and services this year, Rabobank said.\n\n\"The corona crisis is a huge blow to the Dutch economy,\" Barendregt said to NOS. \"Nevertheless, the Dutch expectations this year are still relatively mild if you look at other countries in the eurozone.\" Due to the Netherlands 'intelligent lockdown', not all sectors had to close and the Dutch economy was in good shape when the pandemic started. Combine that with a high degree of digitization in the Netherlands, and the first coronavirus blows were more easily absorbed by the Netherlands than other EU countries, according to the bank. Rabobank expects that the Dutch economy will grow again next year, by 2.9 percent.\n\nOther countries that implemented stricter policies, like France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, are likely to see their economies shrink by over 10 percent this year, according to the bank. But their economic growth will pick up faster next year, with Rabobank expecting growth figures of 7 to 8 percent in the above three countries. \"This is partly a logical consequence of the less deep fall at the beginning of the corona crisis. But it is also because the Netherlands is relatively vulnerable to a drop in demand from abroad.\"",

    "content": "Violeta Delgado was at a protest over food shortages under Chile’s coronavirus lockdowns when the police arrived and fired off a volley of teargas rounds.\n\nDelgado, who was seven months pregnant, says she put her hands up to show she was unarmed, but was struck by a police vehicle and knocked to the ground.\n\n“I couldn’t feel my legs, my friends dragged me to a nearby clinic,” she said. “We thought they were going to kill us.”\n\nThe pandemic has forced many Chileans out of work, and – with only a meagre social safety net – residents of poor neighbourhoods are living in destitution. But demonstrations over hunger have been met by violent repression, according to activists and human rights groups, who say that police have used the enforcement of quarantine orders as a pretext for a crackdown on protest.\n\n“It’s getting worse,” said Ana Piquer, executive director of Amnesty International Chile. “More people are out of work, more people are protesting, so there is more repression. It’s a very direct relation.”\n\nMilitary and the police have roamed the streets to enforce lockdown since March, in scenes reminiscent of the official response to last year’s wave of protests against inequality.\n\nOver six months, millions of Chileans took to the streets over a range of issues, from inadequate pensions and the privatisation of healthcare and education. Protests were met with violent and sometimes deadly repression from security forces, including accusations of torture and sexual assault.\n\nMore than 30 people died and thousands were wounded, including at least 465 people who were shot in the eye by crowd control weapons.\n\nThe human rights violations in turn drove new unrest – and activists say they have continued under the guise of enforcing pandemic orders.\n\nDelgado did not suffer permanent injuries and her baby was unharmed, but she is pursuing legal action against the police. When asked for comment, the Carabineros police force denied her accusation, and said there was insufficient evidence for further investigation.\n\nBut Amnesty International has gathered numerous accounts of arbitrary detentions and abuse including the indiscriminate use of teargas and rubber bullets against people breaking curfew.\n\nIn one notorious case, a woman seeking help from police after being raped, was herself arrested for breaking curfew.\n\nIn a separate incident a woman suffered a miscarriage after being detained by police while walking outside her house in late March.\n\nAccording to the Carabineros,163.957 people were detained for “crimes against public health”, between 19 March, when obligatory quarantines began, and 2 August.\n\nArrests in their thousands are still happening on a daily basis.\n\nPiquer described one case where a detainee was threatened by police, who said “we want to take you to a nearby hospital so you get the virus”.\n\n“They are criminalising protests and people organising in any way – including soup kitchens,” said Piquer. “The pandemic has shown to what extent the inequalities in Chile translate into human rights violations.”Gonzalo Carpintero, who volunteers delivering ingredients to soup kitchens in Santiago’s El Bosque neighbourhood, has taken part in a number of hunger protests despite facing teargas and “non-lethal” firearms from police.\n\nHe said the government’s measures to help vulnerable families – including care packages and a freeze in bill payments – do not provide enough support. Neighbourhood soup kitchens started as early as March but the government only began to send food relief in May.\n\n“We protest against the lack of support. The government wants people to stay at home, but how do they expect us to survive?” he said.\n\nChile has one of the highest global death rates, with 58.28 deaths per 100,000 population, higher than Brazil’s 55.05 deaths. It has more than 400,000 cases and nearly 11,000 deaths.\n\nCarpintero said that hunger protests in El Bosque began peacefully, but quickly turned violent when police retaliated with force.\n\n“You go out to ask for bread or say you are hungry, and in response they shoot teargas.”",

At least seven people died in the disturbances.\n\nThe government deployed paramilitary troops to 22 districts after religious tensions and violence broke out in the city of Cumilla on Wednesday, resulting in the deaths of four Muslims after police fired into crowds.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, further communal violence erupted in the capital, Dhaka, as well as in the southern town of Begumganj. One Muslim and two Hindus died in these incidents, one from stab wounds.\n\nThe trouble was sparked by videos and allegations that spread across social media that a Qur’an, the Muslim holy book, had been placed on the knee of a statue of the Hindu god Hanuman, in a shrine set up for the Hindu holy festival of Durga Puja.After the video went viral on Facebook earlier this week, mobs of more than 500 people gathered in Cumilla and neighbouring districts over the alleged blasphemy. About 10 Hindu temples and shrines were attacked and vandalised by the crowds, who threw stones and smashed statues of the Hindu gods.\n\nIn Cumilla, police shot teargas and fired on the crowds. Dozens were injured, including several police officers.\n\nThe anti-Hindu violence continued into Friday and Saturday. More than 80 special shrines set up for the Durga Puja festival were attacked, with about 150 Hindus injured and two killed.\n\nOn Friday the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, promised severe action in response. “The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated,” said Hasina. “Nobody will be spared. It doesn’t matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished.”\n\nMd Faridul Haque Khan, the state minister for religious affairs, said the incident involving the Qur’an would be investigated but added that communal harmony should be protected and urged people not to take the law into their own hands.\n\nObaidul Quader, a minister with the ruling Awami League government, visited a Hindu shrine in the aftermath of the violence. He said “fanatic elements” were responsible for the attacks on the Hindu festival, adding that the government would “not let them proceed with their evil design”.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Unity Council said in a tweet that it “could not publish” what had happened over the past 24 hours, but stated that “the Hindus of Bangladesh saw the real faces of some people. We don’t know what will happen in the future. But the Hindus of Bangladesh will never forget Durga Puja in 2021.”\n\nHindu religious leaders alleged the attacks were part of a conspiracy to attack their community. Hindus make up 10% of the Muslim-majority country.\n\nIn August, four Hindu temples were attacked in the country’s Khulna district and in March, during a visit by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, hardline Islamist groups attacked Hindu shrines.\n\nThe initial trouble prompted outrage in neighbouring Hindu-majority India.\n\nOn Thursday, the Indian government spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, described the incident as “disturbing” and said officials were in communication with the Bangladesh authorities about the attacks.",

    "content": "El Pardo, Spain (CNN)The remains of former dictator Gen. Francisco Franco have been exhumed in a controversial move that has divided opinion in Spain for decades.\n\nThe Spanish government announced this week that it was to move Franco's remains from the grand mausoleum where he was buried in 1975 to the nearby Mingorrubio state cemetery in El Pardo, 12 miles north of Madrid, where his wife is buried.\nDespite the government's refusal to authorize two demonstrations, about 200 Franco supporters protested at a police blockade near the Mingorrubio cemetery before the exhumation. The Spanish Supreme Court later allowed them to approach the cemetery, where they prayed at the doors.\nThe overall cost of the exhumation came to 63,000 euros ($69,955) and followed a yearlong legal battle between the caretaker Socialist government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and relatives of Franco.The exhumation was one of Sanchez's key policy pledges when he came into power last year and was made a royal decree in August 2018 by the incumbent Socialist Party. Franco's family and his far-right supporters have opposed the plan and the family unsuccessfully appealed the decision in the courts.\nIn a statement, Sanchez said the exhumation ended the \"moral insult that is the exaltation of a dictator in a public space.\"\n\"We move one step closer to reconciliation, that can only exist in the model of coexistence in democracy and freedom that we all share,\" he continued.\n\"It took a long time to free ourselves from a repressive regime. And it has taken almost as long to remove the remains of its maker from public homage.\"Franco's family said the government had violated their \"fundamental rights.\"\n\"What the government presents as a victory for democracy is only a media circus that only seeks propaganda and electoral gains,\" a statement read.\nRepresentatives of the media were not allowed in the basilica in the Valley of the Fallen, but among those witnessing the exhumation were Spain's justice minister, a forensics expert, a priest and 22 of Franco's descendants.\nThe Valley of the Fallen was partially built by political prisoners of Franco's regime and is the site of a mass grave of Spanish Civil War victims. It has become a draw for tourists and far-right sympathizers who conduct annual rallies on the anniversary of Franco's death on November 20.The former dictator was buried under a 1,500kg gravestone that covered the coffin and was also enclosed in a zinc structure. Though there was damage to the coffin, the family chose to keep the remains inside the original casket.\nNo flags or symbols were allowed at the Valley of the Fallen during the exhumation, but six members of the family carried the coffin to a hearse that transported the casket to a helicopter taking the remains to El Pardo.\nA government spokeswoman told CNN that a Mass would take place inside the family vault in El Pardo. A prior of the basilica of The Valley of the Fallen officiated.Franco ruled Spain from the late 1930s until his death. Thousands of executions were carried out by his nationalist regime during the Spanish Civil War and in the following years.\nAfter World War II, he was seen by many as the last surviving fascist dictator and was ostracized by the United Nations. His regime was partly rehabilitated during the Cold War because of Franco's staunch anti-communist ideology.\nIn 2007, the Spanish government passed the Law of Historical Memory, which formally condemns the Franco regime and bans political events at the Valley of the Fallen. It also recognizes the victims of the civil war and the Francoist state and pledges aid to those victims and their descendants.",

Holiday parks and visitor centres were evacuated into Friday night and while the extent of damage to infrastructure isn't known, Mr Pengilly is worried about what will be revealed.\n\n\"To have an island more or less half burnt is unbelievable.\"\n\nThe South Australian Country Fire Service (CFS) issued an extreme fire danger warning early Saturday morning for the Ravine fire on the western end of Kangaroo Island, which said the fire \"increased considerably\" yesterday.\n\nThe fires are at a Watch and Act message.\n\nMr Pengilly said conditions were mild on the island this morning and there was even some light rain, but the CFS warns the fire remains a threat as the conditions are continually changing.\n\nLocal MP Leon Bignell said it had been a long night for those on the island, with people camped out on the Kingscote Oval and others taking shelter in a school gymnasium. He said locals who fled the fire would be looking for information from authorities on when they might return to their properties.\n\n“People over here are in shock, they’re scared, they’re frightened,” Mr Bignell told ABC radio.The Country Fire Service urged people to defer all non-essential travel to Kangaroo Island. Ferry services to Kangaroo Island will operate as scheduled today, but priority will be given to fire vehicles and personnel.\n\nKangaroo Island Mayor Michael Pengilly said part of the island looked like it had been hit by a \"nuclear bomb\".\n\n\"It has been absolutely devastating,\" Mr Pengilly told the ABC, \"... the north coast looks like it has been hit by a nuclear bomb.\"\n\n\"Flinders Chase is going to come out of this badly.

    "content": "China’s easing of domestic travel restrictions is expected to provide a boost to the mainland’s nearly 6 trillion yuan (US$857 billion) market and save thousands of tourism companies teetering on the brink of collapse after struggling for nearly six months due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Ministry of Culture and Tourism’s move on Tuesday night to allow travel agencies to operate group tours across provincial borders also provided a boost to the shares of mainland travel companies.\nThe ministry also eased restrictions on tourist attractions, allowing them to operate at 50 per cent of their capacity, raising the limit from 30 per cent imposed in April.\n“The loosened policies will throw a lifeline to the country’s 40,000 travel agencies,” said Li Wenjie, chief executive of Shanghai Yaheng International Travel. “Most of the small agencies have been on the brink of collapse with zero sales over the past few months.”Since overseas group tours are still banned as the Covid-19 disease has yet to be contained in a number of countries globally, China is keen to direct that tourist spending domestically and boost the slowing economy. Chinese authorities have taken this move before the next big travel season in October after having missed the May Day holiday.\nThe move to allow large groups of people to travel domestically also reflects the Chinese government’s confidence that it has contained the coronavirus after reporting zero new cases for nine consecutive days following an outbreak in Beijing last month.China was the first major global economy to enter into, and emerge from, nationwide lockdowns to contain the coronavirus outbreak, after Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province first reported the disease in January.\nChina’s domestic tourism market, which grew 11.7 per cent in 2019 to 5.73 trillion yuan, represented about 6 per cent of the country’s economic output last year.\nHowever, the coronavirus outbreak in January dealt a massive blow to the industry which is estimated to employ at least 30 million people. Between February and April, nearly all tourist attractions across the country were closed to prevent the spread of the deadly Covid-19 disease.\nIt was estimated that the lockdown and restrictive measures implemented in the three months had caused losses to the tune of at least 1 trillion yuan to the tourism industry.On Wednesday, shares of many travel companies rose by the daily cap of 10 per cent.\nAmong them were shares of Shanghai-listed Huangshan Tourism Development, the operator of scenic spots at Yellow Mountain in Anhui province, which closed at 9.83 yuan.\nJiangsu Tianmu Lake Tourism, also traded in Shanghai, jumped to 32.05 yuan after hitting the daily ceiling.\nShenzhen-listed Zhang Jia Jie Tourism Group, operator of the national park in Hunan province where James Cameron filmed scenes for his movie Avatar, and Xi’an Tourism also climbed by 10 per cent to 5.72 yuan and 9.79 yuan, respectively. Xi’an Tourism operates the museums and tours to the world-renowned terracotta army in central China’s Shaanxi province.Chinese travellers made 48.81 million domestic trips during the May 1 Labour Day holiday, down 49 per cent from a year ago. The four-day holiday brought in revenue of 12.28 billion yuan, a drop of 68.8 per cent from the 39.33 billion yuan last year.\nIn recent years, Chinese tourists have become the biggest driving force of the global market, as increasingly well-to-do mainlanders seek new experiences. The top five destinations of mainland tourists last year were Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.\nLast year, 162 million mainlanders travelled overseas, a 4.6 per cent rise from 2018 and spent an average of US$900 per person.",

We are concerned she may be in that trailer.\n\n\"We are asking the British police to help investigate so that my sister can be returned to the family.\"The last message received from Ms Tra My was at 22:30 BST on Tuesday - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium.\n\nHer family have shared texts she sent to her parents which translated read: \"I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed.\n\n\"I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother.\"\n\nMs Tra My's brother told the BBC her journey to the UK had begun on 3 October. She had told the family not to contact her because \"the organisers\" did not allow her to receive calls.\n\n\"She flew to China and stayed there for a couple days, then left for France,\" he said.\n\n\"She called us when she reached each destination. The first attempt she made to cross the border to the UK was 19 October, but she got caught and turned back. I don't know for sure from which port.\"\n\nThe BBC has passed details of Ms Tra My, who is from Nghen town in Can Loc district of Ha Tinh province area of Vietnam, to Essex Police, along with details of other people claiming to have information.\n\nThe BBC also knows of two other Vietnamese nationals who are missing - a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman.\n\nThe brother of the 19-year-old said his sister called him at 07:20 Belgian local time (06:20 BST) on Tuesday, saying she was getting into a container and was turning off her phone to avoid detection.\n\nHe has not heard from her since.\n\nHe said a people smuggler returned money to the family overnight, and the family of the 26-year-old who she was travelling with also received money back.\n\nA spokesman from the Vietnamese Embassy in London confirmed they had been in contact with Essex police since Thursday.\n\nThey said Vietnamese families had appealed to them for help finding out if their relatives were among the victims but added they had not yet received any official confirmation.The victims of the trailer were 31 men and eight women and Essex Police initially said they were all believed to be Chinese.\n\nThey were found at an industrial estate in Grays at 01:40 BST on Wednesday.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday evening Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said the force was working with the National Crime Agency, the Home Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Border Force and Immigration Enforcement.\n\nShe said she would not be drawn on any further detail about the nationalities of the victims until formal identification processes had taken place.\n\n\"We gave an initial steer on Thursday on nationality, however, this is now a developing picture,\" she said.Police have confirmed the scene at Waterglade Industrial Estate in Eastern Avenue was closed on Friday.\n\nEssex Police also urged anyone fearing their loved ones may have been in the lorry to get in touch.\n\n\"I can't begin to comprehend what some of you must be going through right now. You have my assurance that Essex Police will be working tirelessly to understand the whole picture to this absolute tragedy,\" said Det Ch Con Mills.\n\nShe also urged anyone living illegally in the UK who may have information to come forward, without fear of criminal action being taken against them.\n\nGPS data shows the refrigerated container trailer crossed back and forth between the UK and Europe in the days before it was found.\n\nIt was leased from the company Global Trailer Rentals on 15 October. The company said it was \"entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been\".\n\nEssex Police said the tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) had entered the UK via Holyhead - an Irish Sea port in Wales - on Sunday 20 October, having travelled over from Dublin.Police believe the tractor unit collected the trailer in Purfleet on the River Thames and left the port shortly after 01:05 on Thursday. Police were called to the industrial park where the bodies were discovered about half an hour later.\n\nTemperatures in refrigerated units can be as low as -25C (-13F). The lorry now is at a secure site in Essex.\n\nA spokesman for the UN International Organization for Migration said the discovery of bodies in Essex did not necessarily indicate a major shift in migration patterns.\n\n\"These are the kind of random crimes that occur every day in the world somewhere,\" he said. \"They get huge attention when they do but they don't necessarily indicate a big shift in migration or patterns in any place in particular. It's just the condition of what happens when this many people are engaging this many criminal groups to reach a destination, which of course we deplore.\"\n\nDetectives are still questioning the lorry driver, Mo Robinson, of County Armagh in Northern Ireland, on suspicion of murder. He was arrested on Wednesday.\n\nTwo other people were also earlier arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.\n\nThe man and woman, both 38, from Warrington, Cheshire, are also being held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nPolice officers were seen at the couple's home address in Warrington, with a police van and two squad cars parked outside.\n1. Sources say the GPS data shows it left Monaghan in the Republic of Irelandon 15 October before crossing over to Northern Ireland and then returningsouth to Dublin\n2. From Dublin, it crossed over to Holyhead in Wales overnight on 16 October\n3. That evening, it travelled to continental Europe from Dover to Calais inFrance\n4. Between 17 and 22 October, it moved between various cities in Belgiumand France, including Dunkirk, Bruges and Lille\n5. On 22 October, it made its final crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet",

It was reduced to rubble on 18 May, during the 11-day conflict that killed more than 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel.\n\nNow a fundraiser managed by human rights lawyers Mahvish Rukhsana and Clive Stafford Smith has raised more than $200,000 (£141,000) to help rebuild the shop, while tens of thousands of donated books have been sent from all over the world to help Mansour restock.Rukhsana said the response from the international community had been overwhelming.\n\n“Dropping bombs on Samir Mansour’s bookshop is not the worst tragedy to have hit the people of Gaza – but this particular air strike targeted access to books. It was an attack on the knowledge and literacy of this community. Samir lost almost 100,000 books and served schoolchildren and adults alike,” said Rukhsana. “I knew hospital and roads would receive funding, but secondary cultural institutions such as libraries are often overlooked but equally critical to the community.”\n\nRukhsana said they are aiming to replace all of Mansour’s 100,000 books and rebuild his bookshop. They also aim to help him establish a new project: the Gaza Cultural Centre, which would be a new library next door, from which readers could borrow books without paying.\n\n“[In Mansour’s shop], people were allowed to stay, have tea and read his books for as long as they wanted free of charge without an obligation to purchase … he has decided to use all gently used and some new books to create a true library,” she said.\n\nIn a written comment to the Guardian, Mansour said his “heart was burning” when he realised missiles had hit the building containing his shop.\n\n“The Israeli airstrikes bombed half of the building and my bookshop was in the other half. I wished they would stop … My feet took me a few steps forward, towards the bookshop. The last missile came and destroyed the building,” he said.\n\n“It was six in the morning. I didn’t know what to do. I started searching among the rubble for anything related to my library. But everything was under the rubble.”\n\nHe searched for an hour as he tried to make sense of what had happened, before going home. “I sat thinking about why my shop was bombed,” he said. “I did not publish, write, or attack any country or person in my life. I did not spread hatred but spread culture, science and love. I did not find answers to my questions.” But he vowed that he would “rebuild all over again, no matter what it took from me”.\n\nUK-based online children’s bookseller Books2Door has donated 1,000 books to the campaign to rebuild Mansour’s shop, with founder Abdul Thadha describing the situation as devastating.\n\n“Without any hesitation I knew we could help,” he said. “We were kindly informed by the fundraisers that Samir had a diverse, eclectic collection, so we hope we have done him proud.”\n\nRukhsana and Stafford Smith said the donations would help the bookstore “rise as a phoenix from the ashes”.\n\n“With this kind of support now all we need is some humanitarian cooperation from the Israeli and Gaza authorities,” they added.\n\nA ceasefire between Israeli and Palestinian militants was agreed on 21 May. But Israel launched further airstrikes on the Gaza Strip on 17 June, in response to Palestinian militants launching incendiary balloons into Israel. This came after Israel allowed far-right Jewish nationalists, some of whom chanted “Death to Arabs”, to march through Arab neighbourhoods of Jerusalem after the ceasefire.",

The researcher responsible for the “molécule miracle” is Didier Raoult. The founder and director of Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire, or IHU, in Marseille, the 68-year-old Raoult has compiled a sometimes dazzling, sometimes disturbing career that could have been scripted by Marcel Pagnol or Honoré de Balzac. Born in Senegal, Raoult defied his father, who was serving there as a military doctor, and quit high school in his junior year. Signing up with the French merchant marine, the young Raoult spent the next two years at sea.\n\nReturning to France, he graduated from medical school and nimbly made his way in both the political and professional worlds. Not only did he become an internationally recognized researcher, but he was also a nationally recognized power player. Cultivating politicians as carefully as he did petri dishes, Raoult overcame the opposition of older research institutions and, with the support of then-President Nicolas Sarkozy, created the IHU 10 years ago. Despite the doubts, Raoult’s work on infectious disease earned him a place on the French government’s COVID-19 commission.\n\nNot surprisingly, Raoult’s rapid rise raised as many eyebrows as huzzahs. While his fans applaud the 3,000 scientific articles Raoult has co-signed, his critics argue that these staggering numbers do not add up. Do the math, they remark, and it turns out the Marseillais researcher publishes more papers in a month than most productive researchers publish in a career. Raoult’s method, according to one critic, is to task a young researcher at IHU with an experiment, then co-sign the piece before it is submitted to publication. “Raoult is thus able to reach this absolutely insane number of publications every year,” according to one anonymous source quoted by the site Mediapart. More disturbingly, the critic added, “it is simply impossible for Raoult to verify all of these papers.”Indeed, the question of verification hovers over Raoult’s clinical trial on the effects of hydroxychloroquine on the novel coronavirus. Combining a regimen of Plaquenil—the commercial name of hydroxychloroquine—and an antibiotic, Raoult treated 24 patients at IHU in early March who had tested positive for COVID-19. After six days, the virus had vacated the bodies of three-quarters of those same patients. On March 16, Raoult announced the results not in a scientific journal but in a YouTube video, in which he declared the jig was up for the virus. Predictably, his self-proclaimed victory then ignited the hysteria that has since swept the world and reached as far as the Oval Office.\n\nIn France, pharmacies have been overwhelmed by demands for Plaquenil, leading one pharmacist quoted by Le Monde to exclaim: “Perhaps Raoult is right, but instead of taking the time to carry out a serious study, he has given us two months of theatrics.”\n\nCritics argue that not only were there too few subjects in the chloroquine study, but that some of them dropped out during the trial, potentially skewing the results. In addition, Raoult has not released the raw data from the trial, which, remarkably, was not double-blinded. According to Dominique Costagliola, chief epidemiologist at the Pasteur Institute, the trial was so slapdash that “it is impossible to interpret the described result as being attributable to the hydroxychloroquine treatment.”\n\nIf this sounds depressingly familiar, it should. There are several disquieting parallels between the stable genius who claims to “understand that whole scientific world” and the reputed genius who claims to have defeated COVID-19. Like Trump, Raoult has made himself a brand: the outsider who defies a sclerotic and corrupt establishment. Like Trump, Raoult is not just a climate skeptic—in 2013, he declared that climate predictions are “absurd”—but a pandemic skeptic. “Three people in China die from a virus, and that sparks a global alert,” he observed in an IHU video. “This is crazy.” The video was posted on Jan. 21, just one day before Trump reassured Americans that he had the virus “totally under control.”\nPOPULAR IN NEWS & POLITICS\nThe Biggest Lie About Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” Bill Erases One Crucial Word\nWhy Blaming Joe Biden for High Gas Prices Is Completely and Utterly Absurd\nRussia Is Committing War Crimes.

In effect, he has told the world that he alone can fix it. On Sunday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency authorization to add the drug to the Strategic National Stockpile, permitting doctors to use it in cases they deem critical. Yet the clinical trials must still run their proper course. For now, Raoult has given unproven hope to millions, uncharted dangers for those afflicted with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and unavoidable despair for those who listen to the U.S. president’s daily press briefings.",

    "content": "By Krishna N. Das and Aftab Ahmed\n\nKUALA LUMPUR/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indonesia has agreed to immediately increase imports of Indian buffalo meat, sugar and auto parts after India boosted purchases of Indonesian palm oil amid a spat with rival supplier Malaysia, two Indian government sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia account for 85% of the world's palm oil output while India is the biggest buyer of edible oil. India has effectively halted imports of refined palm oil from Malaysia since early January in retaliation for Malaysia's accusation that recent Indian policies discriminate against Muslims.\n\nIndia is a Hindu-majority country while Malaysia is mainly Muslim.\n\nIndonesia, the world's biggest palm oil producer and exporter, is expected to be the biggest beneficiary of India's row with Malaysia. Indonesian crude palm oil has sold at a premium to Malaysian oil since India this month placed curbs on imports of refined palm oil.\n\nThe trade ministers of India and Indonesia, which want to more than double their bilateral trade to $50 billion by 2025, met in Davos on Thursday and agreed to fast-forward trade between them, one of the informed sources said.\n\n\"This is a goal we agreed upon earlier, now the process accelerates,\" said the Indian source. Both declined to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media.\n\n\"Starting now, they have promised that they will buy a lot more meat, a lot more sugar and autos/autoparts. Palm oil imports from Indonesia will increase and there are many areas where we will export more.\"\n\nThe sources declined to give figures.\n\nAn Indian government document, reviewed by Reuters, said that Indonesia had \"informally agreed\" to double the annual quota for Indian bovine meat exports to 200,000 tonnes.\n\nIndian-Indonesian trade was worth $21.2 billion in the last fiscal year that ended in March, $15.84 billion of which comprised Indian purchases.\n\nIndonesian Trade Minister Agus Suparmanto will visit India next month to hold further talks on enhancing trade, according to one of the Indian government sources.\n\nA spokeswoman for Indonesia's trade ministry had no immediate comment. An Indian trade ministry spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nIndonesia imported 94,500 tonnes of Indian buffalo meat worth $323 million in the 2018/19 fiscal year. It is the third biggest buyer of Indian buffalo meat after Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\nIndonesia, however, bought only 555 tonnes of sugar from India last fiscal year.\n\n\"They have now changed some of their norms to let more Indian sugar come in,\" said one of the sources. \"In other areas, there's an ongoing process of discussion on easing regulations or standards, or increasing quotas in these areas.\"\n\nMalaysia's top sugar refiner told Reuters on Thursday that it would increase purchases of sugar from India, a move that two sources in Malaysia said was part of efforts to placate New Delhi amid the palm spat.",

    "content": "VATICAN CITY -- With Prince Charles looking on, Pope Francis on Sunday canonized Cardinal John Henry Newman, praising the 19th-century Anglican convert who became an influential, unifying figure in both the Anglican and Catholic churches.\n\nFrancis quoted from one of Newman's most famous hymns, \"Lead, Kindly Lights,\" as he presided over Mass on Sunday before an estimated 50,000 people in a sun-drenched St. Peter's Square to declare Newman and four women saints.Among the luminaries on hand was Charles, heir to the British throne, who penned a remarkable ode to Newman that was published in the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano. The Prince of Wales, whose mother is the head of the Church of England, praised Newman for bridging divisions and showing the courage of following his convictions.\n\nNewman, a theologian and poet, is admired by Catholics and Anglicans alike because he followed his conscience at great personal cost. When he defected from the Church of England to the Catholic Church in 1845, he lost friends, work and even family ties, believing the truth he was searching for could only be found in the Catholic faith.\n\nIn his homily, Francis recalled that the Christian \"journey of faith\" sometimes is an uphill, uncomfortable battle such as the one Newman experienced.\n\n\"Faith calls for journey, a 'going out' from ourselves, and it can work wonders if we abandon our comforting certainties, if we leave our safe harbors and our cozy nests,\" he said. \"Faith increases by giving and grows by taking risks.\"\n\nFrancis concluded his homily quoting from Newman's hymn, penned when the theologian fell ill while travelling and was apparently longing for the certainties of home and faith.\n\n\"Let us ask to be like that, \"kindly lights\" amid the encircling gloom,\" Francis said.\n\nAnglicans split from Rome in 1534 when English King Henry VIII was refused a marriage annulment. In the centuries that followed, Catholics in Britain were fined, discriminated against and killed for their faith.\n\nIn his editorial, Charles said that Newman's fearless, honest example was needed today in an era marked by division and intolerance \"for the manner in which, at his best, he could advocate without accusation, could disagree without disrespect and, perhaps most of all, could see differences as places of encounter rather than exclusion.\"\n\nHe echoed Francis by saying all Christians can give thanks for Newman's example and friendship.\n\n\"In the image of divine harmony which Newman expressed so eloquently, we can see how, ultimately, as we follow with sincerity and courage the different paths to which conscience calls us, all our divisions can lead to a greater understanding and all our ways can find a common home,\" Charles wrote.\n\nNewman was one of the founders of the so-called Oxford Movement of the 1830s, which sought to revive certain Roman Catholic doctrines in the Church of England by looking back to the traditions of the earliest Christian church.\n\nBut he gave up a brilliant academic career at Oxford University and the pulpit of the university church to convert to Catholicism in 1845. As a Catholic, he became one of the most influential theologians of the era, bringing elements of the Anglican church into his new faith tradition.\n\nNewman's legacy is complex for Anglicans and Catholics alike: Liberals like his emphasis on conscience while conservatives admire his submission to authority and his devotion to celibacy. Yet some gay activists have claimed him as one of their own, as Newman was buried in the same grave as the Rev. Ambrose St. John, his companion of more than 30 years.\n\nPilgrims from across the English Channel flooded the canonization ceremony toting Union Jacks, many of them participating in a dayslong celebration in Rome that included conferences, walking tours and exhibitions about Newman's life and trials.\n\n\"He was the most wonderful priest for the poor people,\" said U.K. philanthropist Clive Richards, who came to Rome for the event. \"It was the poor people of central Birmingham who he looked after, and they were the people who lined the route to his funeral.\"\n\nOn the eve of his canonization, one of the Vatican's most senior English-speaking officials, Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, declared that Newman should be made a doctor of the church to honor the tremendous influence his writings had on the development of Christian doctrine.\n\nOuellet choked up as he delivered a speech on Newman and his role in bridging the theological gaps between the Anglican and Catholic traditions.\n\nNewman was canonized along with four women, including three nuns from the 19th and 20th centuries — Sisters Giuseppina Vannini of Italy, Mariam Thresia Chiramel Mankidiyan of India and Brazilian Dulce Lopes Pontes — as well as Swiss laywoman Margherita Bays.\n\nBorn in 1914 to a well-to-do family in Brazil, Lopes Pontes dedicated herself to the country's poor and founded several charitable organizations. The Roman-born Vannini, meanwhile, was orphaned at 7 yet went onto found a religious order dedicated to caring for the sick.\n\nMankidiyan, an Indian nun who is said to have suffered from the stigmata wounds of Christ, also founded a congregation that looked after the poor and the outcast. Bays, a seamstress, is said to have suffered the stigmata as well.\n\n\"They walked in faith and now we invoke their intercession,\" Francis said of the five new saints.",

Those least affected by the climate crisis are often those who have contributed to it the most and have fueled climate denialism throughout history.\n\nTo prevent the climate crisis from becoming the worst catastrophe in the history of the planet, we must make a complete transition to sustainable and egalitarian economic systems, with energy grids based on renewable sources and the preservation of nature and ecosystems at their core. This is not an option.\n\nPublic financial institutions and development banks that help finance fossil fuel projects are a double insult to people. Instead of paving the way towards the sustainable future we all need, they are exacerbating climate chaos and creating more illegitimate debt that our generations will have to pay for with our lives. \n\nWe are fed up with having to pay for their deliberate greed. \nTyphoon Goni, the strongest typhoon on the planet this year, affected hundreds of thousands of people in the Philippines, leaving many homeless, hungry, and cold. The flooding in Bihar, India displaced seven million people. \n\nWhile having to cope with a pandemic, 783 million people in Africa and 76 million people in India don’t have access to safe water supply. And most recently, hurricane Eta has brought devastation upon Central America. \n\nOur demands for social and environmental justice must be heard. \n\nWe have been threatened by anti-democratic regimes, but we refuse to let the oppressors win. We need people-centered climate action. We need to put people over profit. We are rising to say never again to financial and ecological terrorism from governments, corporations or international finance organisations. \n\nAnd we will not stop until we win a more sustainable future for our generation and the next.\n\nThis year needs to be a turning point. We must use the response to this pandemic to transition to a just and sustainable future. This must include debt cancellation for the poorest nations, an immediate end to fossil fuel subsidies and investments and locally-adapted green recovery measures.\nUntil the current exploitative and hyper-extractive system is changed, we will keep fighting for climate justice, for our lives and for those that have been taken away.\n\nFirm commitments from public financial institutions at the Finance in Common Summit this week are critical to manage the transition risks to a low-carbon economy and to unleash private investments towards the clean energy future we all want.\n\nTo the ones controlling our money, we say: if you don’t want to do what is just, then do what is necessary. We are not fighting for the planet, we are fighting for our lives. World leaders, take us seriously: we need climate justice today, not tomorrow. \n\nHelp us build our future. Do not destroy it. We are counting on you.",

If there are, it’s likely some sports will have to be moved to new sites.

At a press conference Wednesday, it was alleged that the younger brother appeared to be “the ringleader” in the operation.\n\nReferring to recent deaths potentially linked to vaping nationwide, Sheriff Beth said at the press conference, “Across this nation, we have lost 6 people. Hundreds of people have been hurt.”\n\n“The magnitude of this [particular] operation was scary to me,” Beth tells PEOPLE. “Having children in high school right now, and seeing basically high levels of THC put into packaging that makes it look like harmless kid’s candy, is scary as a parent and infuriating as law enforcement.”\n\n“It is a national epidemic,” he adds. “There isn’t a day that goes by that vaping has not come up in a conversation.”\n\nHuffhines is expected to be charged with the manufacturing, distributing and delivery of marijuana THC of more than 10,000 grams, possession with the intent to manufacture, distribute and deliver marijuana THC of more than 10,000 grams; keeping a drug house and unauthorized use of individual’s personal and identification information.\n\nBeth says investigators confiscated approximately 31,000 THC-filled vape cartridges that were ready to be shipped as well as $59,000 in cash, firearms and ammunition.\n\nAccording to FOX6, investigators also discovered around 98,000 empty vape cartridges and over 50 mason jars filled with THC oil. The estimated amount of the THC products taken during the raid was $1.5 million, FOX reports.\n\n Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.\n\nThe confiscated product packaging allegedly claimed to have 5 milligrams of THC in each cartridge but Beth says the amount was much higher.\n\n“What our suspects were doing were filling these cartridges with 157 times the level that was on the back of the packaging,” he says.\n\nDetectives are still trying to determine how big the counterfeit vaping network is and how many others may be involved.\n\n“We are trying to figure out who all the players are,” he says. “The web keeps getting bigger every single day. This is a priority case and all hands are on deck to bring those involved in to custody.”\n\nThe investigation began in early July after worried parents stopped by the police department to report that their high school-aged son was allegedly distributing the vape cartridges, FOX reports.\n\n“It was right underneath our nose in a nice neighborhood,” says Beth.\n\nThe arrests come alongside an increased spotlight on the health issues surrounding vaping. Officials are currently investigating six deaths potentially linked to the practice.\n\nAlong with the deaths, the Centers for Disease Control are investigating more than 450 reported cases of severe lung illness linked to vaping from U.S. residents of all ages.\n\nTyler Huffhines’ attorney, Mark Richards, did not return a call for commen",

It identified the U.S. Department of Defense as the largest contributor at $6.5 billon.\n\nSIGAR found that about $2.4 billion “in assets that were unused or abandoned had not been used for their intended purposes, had deteriorated, or were destroyed.”\n\nBy contrast, the report said, more than $1.2 billion out of the $7.8 billion in U.S.-funded assets were being used as intended, and only $343.2 million worth of assets were “maintained in good condition.” The study quoted Special Inspector General John Sopko as saying they determined a pattern of U.S. agencies “pouring too much money, too quickly, into a country too small to absorb it.”\n\nIn violation of multiple U.S. laws, many of the U.S.-funded facilities and assets were provided to the Afghan government even without asking them if they wanted or needed the buildings or if they had the technical ability to keep them running.\n\n“The fact that so many capital assets wound up not used, deteriorated or abandoned should have been a major cause of concern for the agencies financing these projects,” Sopko said.\n\nAs of last December 2020, Washington had appropriated about $143 billion for reconstruction and related activities in Afghanistan since 2002, according to SIGAR. The massive expenditure was intended to foster goodwill and jump-start development that U.S. officials hoped would help spur peace and stability in the conflict-torn country.\n\nU.S. lawmakers created SIGAR in 2008 to identify waste, fraud and abuse in American taxpayer-funded projects in Afghanistan. The agency has since been producing quarterly reports, often exposing serious gaps in planning and contract execution.\n\nSIGAR’s latest findings come as President Joe Biden is reassessing a peace agreement that his predecessor, Donald Trump, signed with the Taliban insurgency a year ago to promote a negotiated settlement to the 19-year-old Afghan war.\n\nThe deal requires the remaining 2,500 U.S. troops to leave Afghanistan by May 1, 2021, to close what has been the longest-running U.S. war, costing Washington the lives of more than 2,400 soldiers and nearly $1 trillion.\n\nSIGAR noted that the actual amount of waste “is almost certainly higher” because it has not inspected all U.S.-funded “capital asset projects” in Afghanistan.",

The automated chatbot, which is available to access 24/7, would then offer the bookings option. A user must be able to provide their Medical Record Number (MRN) in order to book.\n\nThe chatbot then provides a choice of vaccination centres to choose from, along with dates and timings.\n\nWhilst the United Arab Emirates (UAE) currently has four vaccines approved for use - Sinopharm, Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Sputnik V – the DHA currently only shows appointments for Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nEarlier today, it was confirmed that Dubai has started to provide the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to 12-15 year olds.\n\nMeanwhile, last month the UAE announced it was to provide a third shot to recipients of the Sinopharm vaccine, six months after the initial two doses regimen. This reportedly made the Gulf country the first worldwide to formally introduce the booster.\n\nDHA’s WhatsApp service was initially launched in order to keep the community updated on developments relating to COVID-19. According to the authority, the multilingual service has processed more than 150,000 COVID-19 enquiries to date.\n\nIn a statement by Facebook MENA, “WhatsApp has partnered with more than 150 national, state, and local governments as well as organisations like WHO and UNICEF, on COVID-19 helplines to connect its two billion users to accurate information and resources. \n\n“Over three billion messages have been sent across these global helplines in the past year.”\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n“Through the use of AI technology and this additional channel to book an appointment for the COVID-19 vaccine, we aim to provide community members with the utmost convenience. The new service will further bolster our vaccination drive,” said Fatma Al Khajah, director of DHA’s Customer Happiness Department.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the UAE has among the world’s highest immunisation rates, with approximately two thirds of the population having already taken two doses of Pfizer-BioNtTech, Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, or Sputnik V vaccines.",

As a result, the Maryland Scholarship was created.\n\nIn addition to his student liaison position, Swalwell also serves as the SGA vice president and the city's student redistricting commission member.\n\nCouncilman Eric Olson (Dist. 3) credits Swalwell with enhancing relations between students, the city and university.\n\n\"He's brought a voice to the city that reflects ... the student population's concerns,\" he said. \"I think students are more aware of what we do.\"",

The action is being taken as part of the University's overall redesign to emerge from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a way that financially stabilizes the institution.\n \nAffected by the decision are the sports of men's cross country, men's golf and women's tennis. With the change, UA, which previously sponsored 20 sports, will now have 17 sports (7 men's sports and 10 women's sports). Akron will remain a member of The Mid-American Conference (MAC).\n \nThe move affects 23 male and 9 female student-athletes. The elimination of these sports, along with salary reductions for select coaches, staff position eliminations, scholarship and operating expenditure reductions will total approximately $4.4 million.\n \n\"These decisions are very difficult but they are important and necessary at this time,\" said Director of Athletics Larry Williams. \"This action aligns us with our Mid-American Conference peers in the total number of sports and is part of the ongoing effort to redesign the University to ensure that UA continues to invest in high-demand, high-quality academic programs.\"\n \nWilliams continued, \"This morning, I met via video conference with the student-athletes affected by the decision. We understand that some may choose to leave Akron to continue in their sport at another university, and we have committed to offering them our full support throughout that process. This is a difficult day for all of us. We have dedicated student-athletes, coaches and athletics staff who have embraced being a Zip and make tremendous contributions to campus life in class, in competition and in our greater community.\"\n \nWilliams said the announcement was made today to allow the student-athletes as much time as possible to find new schools at which they can continue in their sports, if they choose to do so. This also will allow the three coaches and one graduate assistant who are impacted time to find new positions.\n \nIn reaching this decision, the University considered many factors, including: program cost, athletics facilities, University and community impacts, and likelihood of noteworthy success at the current and future funding levels.\n \nFurther details regarding the decision can be found in the FAQ document posted on the University website.",

    "content": "Protests have erupted in Barcelona after Spain's Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalan separatist leaders to between nine and 13 years in prison.\n\nThe separatists were convicted of sedition over their role in an illegal independence referendum in 2017.\n\nAnother three were found guilty of disobedience and fined, but not jailed. All 12 defendants denied the charges.\n\nLarge crowds of pro-independence protesters clashed with police at Barcelona's international airport.\n\nFootage showed people attempting to break through a police line blocking one area of the building, while in another, officers hit protesters with batons and attempted to disperse the crowds with gas.\n\nA total of 108 flights were cancelled on Monday, the Spanish airport authority Aena said.Thousands of Catalan independence supporters also marched in the city centre, blocking some streets and access to metro stations.\n\nAfter the ruling, a new arrest warrant was issued for former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, who is living abroad. Mr Puigdemont told a press conference that Catalonians were victims of a \"strategy of repression and revenge\".\n\nWhat happened at the trial?\nSome of the 12 leaders sentenced on Monday had held prominent positions in Catalonia's government and parliament, while others were influential activists and cultural advocates.\n\nDuring four months of hearings, they told the court in Madrid that they were victims of an injustice in a trial built on \"false\" charges.The longest sentence of 13 years was handed to Oriol Junqueras, the former vice-president of Catalonia and the highest-ranking pro-independence leader on trial, for sedition and misuse of public funds.\n\nThe prosecution had sought up to 25 years in prison for Junqueras.The new European and international arrest warrant against Mr Puigdemont was issued on grounds of sedition and misuse of public funds.\n\nHe fled to Belgium in October 2017 to avoid prosecution in Spain following the failed independence bid.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\nJunqueras accused Spain of jailing people for their political ideals and pledged that the separatists would return even stronger.\n\nBut Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez insisted the leaders had been jailed for criminal conduct.\n\nMr Puigdemont said the sentences handed to separatist leaders of \"100 years in total\" were \"an atrocity\".\n\n\"Now more than ever... it is time to react like never before,\" he wrote on Twitter, adding: \"For the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia.\"\n\nThose on the street communicated feelings of anger and powerlessness.\n\n\"Today is going to be historic, you can feel it in the atmosphere. Serious things are happening, we can't stay home,\" Oscar Quiles, a 47-year-old real estate entrepreneur told AFP news agency.\n\n\"The indignation is just too much and affects too many people,\" another protester said. \"What they don't realise is that we are very angry and we will not stop.\"Anger spills on to the streets of Barcelona\nBy Damian Grammaticas, Europe correspondent\n\nThe sentences handed down have shocked many across Catalonia. Shortly after they were announced small knots of students - banners and flags held aloft - began marching in Barcelona, heading for the squares where they gathered during the independence bid two years ago.\n\nAnger swirled in the air along with sound of whistles and loudhailers. \"This is not justice, this is revenge\" they shouted. Madrid deployed police reinforcements in the region and sections of the city's streets were cordoned off to traffic.\n\nThe prison terms given to the Catalan independence leaders were not the 25 years prosecutors had sought in some cases, but they are nevertheless seen as an outrage by many Catalans.\n\nline\nThe Catalan National Assembly called for \"mobilisations around the globe\" - including in the UK, France and Germany - in a tweet using the hashtag #StandUpForCatalonia.\n\nOthers used the hashtag to post footage of students marching in protest against the sentences moments after they were announced on Monday.Meanwhile, both FC Barcelona and the Catalan football federation condemned the prison sentences and called for \"dialogue and negotiation\" to resolve the situation.\n\nThe federation added that it had suspended all football matches in the region to show solidarity with the leaders and their families.\n\nOver the weekend, hundreds of protesters rallied in the city.In 2017, police and protesters clashed in the streets when Catalonia's pro-independence leaders went ahead with the referendum, which had been ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court.\n\nWho else has been sentenced?\nOther separatist leaders to receive prison sentences for sedition were:\n\nDolors Bassa, former Catalan labour minister (12 years)\nJordi Turull, former Catalan government spokesman (12 years)\nRaül Romeva, former Catalan external relations minister (12 years)\nCarme Forcadell, ex-speaker of the Catalan parliament (11.5 years)\nJoaquim Forn, former Catalan interior minister (10.5 years)\nJosep Rull, former Catalan territorial minister (10.5 years)\nJordi Sànchez, activist and ex-president of the Catalan National Assembly (9 years)\nJordi Cuixart, president of Catalan language and culture organisation Òmnium Cultural (9 years)\nThe nine leaders, who had already spent months in pre-trial detention, were acquitted of a more serious charge of rebellion.\n\nThe remaining three defendants were earlier released on bail.\n\nDuring their closing arguments in June, defence lawyers told the court their clients denied the charges of rebellion and sedition, but admitted to the lesser charge of disobedience which could have seen them be banned from public office but avoid prison.\n\nHow did they end up in court?\nProsecutors argued that the unilateral declaration of independence was an attack on the Spanish state and accused some of those involved of a serious act of rebellion.They also said that separatist leaders had misused public funds while organising the 2017 referendum.\n\nProsecutors argued the leaders had carried out a \"perfectly planned strategy... to break the constitutional order and obtain the independence of Catalonia\" illegally.Forcadell, the former parliament speaker who read out the independence result on 27 October 2017, was also accused of allowing parliamentary debates on independence despite warnings from Spain's Constitutional Court.\n\nSome of the leaders, speaking to the BBC ahead of the trial, said the proceedings were political in nature. Any violence, they said, was on the part of police and committed against voters in a crackdown which made headlines around the world.\n\nThree weeks after the banned 2017 vote, the Catalan parliament declared an independent republic.\n\nMadrid stepped in to impose its rule on the region, and several Catalan leaders fled or were arrested.\n\nWhat is behind the Catalonia controversy?\nCatalan nationalists have long complained that their region, which has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years, sends too much money to poorer parts of Spain, as taxes are controlled by Madrid.\n\nThe wealthy region is home to about 7.5 million people, with their own language, parliament, flag and anthem.\n\nIn September, a march in Barcelona in support of Catalonia's independence from Spain drew crowds of about 600,000 people - one of the lowest turnouts in the eight-year history of the annual rally.",
