    "content": "Can a couscous curb abstention? An association in Tunisia believes that it can. Tunisia Youth Impact is using cooking contests to encourage young Tunisian women in rural villages to go to the ballot box and vote in the country’s presidential election. \n\nADVERTISING\nIt is Saturday, October 12, in the small rural town of Echamine, around 20km south of Tunis. The next day, the country will vote in the second round of a presidential election pitting Nabil Karoui against Kais Saied in a head-to-head runoff.\n\nBut the chances are that here and in towns like it across the country, not everyone – in fact fewer than half of voters – will be heading to the ballot box. In the first round, the national turnout was just 48.98%.\n\nTunisia Youth Impact is hoping to change that, all through the power of gastronomy. Its Voticook cooking contests, in which participants vote for the winner, aims to raise awareness among rural populations, and particularly women, of the importance of participating in the democratic process.\n\nPractice vote\n\n“It’s a practice vote,” explains Wafa Tarhouni, president of the association. “It’s a competition between a certainnumber of women who compete through their dishes to be elected by the diners at the meal.”\n\nFrom electoral lists to voting booths and sealed ballot boxes, the volunteers from Tunisia Youth Impact strive to match as closely as possible real-life voting conditions. The only difference is that the ink into which voters in Tunisia are normally required to dip their fingers to show they have cast their ballot has been replaced by a mixture of water and shampoo.\n\nIn Echamine, the day’s contest is being held in the concrete courtyard of a two-story house, still only half-built. It is the home of mother-of-four Hinda Jlass who, surrounded by her children and with a smile on her face, is preparing her own couscous for the competition.\n\n“This event is above all a way of getting together with other women, and the essential thing is to participate,” she says.\n\nParticipating is something the 50-year-old housewife also plans to do on Sunday when she will cast her ballot in the second round of the presidential election. It will be only the second time she has voted in her life.At noon, Jlass is joined by the other competitors from the village, seven in all. These are the candidates. But rather than a political programme they will be presenting their best culinary creations to the electors – in this case a group of around fifty people.\n\nEU observers\n\nEach competitor will get a chance to say a few words about their dish – mainly couscous but also plates of macaroni and a rice dish, all accompanied by traditional mechouia salads and honey-flavoured makroudh pastries.\n\nThe “electors” will taste each concoction before voting for their favourite, using the exact same procedure they will use to cast their ballot in the presidential election the next day. Tunisia Youth Impact volunteers will be on hand to guide them through the voting process and make sure no one misses a step that might invalidate their vote.\n\nAdding to the realism is the presence of members of the ISIE, the Tunisian election authority, and Stefan Ziegler, a European Union election observer.“It’s original and everyone seems to be having fun,” Ziegler says with a smile. “It can only be a good thing for Tunisian democracy.”\n\nAfter the vote, the ballots are counted. It is another opportunity for volunteers to point out the mistakes that might lead to a vote being declared invalid: a signature instead of a cross next to the chosen candidate, for example.\n\nA clear winner soon emerges: Najwa Jlass, the sister of the hostess.\n\n“I’m of course very happy to have won,” she says, clearly a little moved. “But what makes me happier is to see our community come together like this.” She adds that she will be going to vote “for real” the next day.",

    "content": "Crime is a phenomenon that adapts to the changing contours of the society in which it is embedded, following closely its economic and social development, and reproducing its mechanisms. The more complex the society, the more sophisticated the criminal culture needed to subvert and exploit its weaknesses. The development of criminal means evolves from the opportunistic violations by individuals to a more and more differentiated crime structure.\n\n     Present day organized crime (OC) is quite different from that of the past. It has the flexibility to change its methods and to fit seamlessly into the dynamics of modern society. A prime example is the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, which has succeeded in adjusting with little interruption to a Sicilian economy that changed from village-agrarian based to urban-industrial based. The changes have been many, including the types of investments of Cosa Nostra’s ill-gotten gains. In the first instance wealth was achieved with the progressive acquisition of land. With urbanization and the rise of the managerial class, the concept of wealth has become the acquisition of real property and businesses.\n\n     OC has become a series of networks, a set of alliances, often across national boundaries, both among criminal groups and common criminals. Also, essential to this mix are the links between the underworld and legitimate institutions and white-collar interests, which form a continuum along a spectrum from purely criminal to the purely legal. The criminal seeks to entice \"honest\" persons to break the law for mutual profit, in some cases to the extent of blurring the distinction between the crook and those he corrupts.\n\n     Trafficking in narcotics is a case in point. Trafficking results in the corruption, threatening and killing of policemen and judges who attempt to impede the flow of illegal drugs and bring to justice the guilty. In turn, the consumers of drugs are sometimes forced by circumstances to commit crimes to obtain the cash to maintain their drug habits. The proceeds from the drug market are laundered and reinvested into the legal economy. The consequence is a variety of crimes—common, economic, organized—that are intertwined, where one result is the function of the others. OC, thus, has an impact on the society that goes far beyond the mere act of criminality. Through arrogance and total self-interest OC seeks to gain a power monopoly to the determent of the body politic. Unlike the legitimate businessman, whose greed for gain is limited by the public interest, the organized criminal does not play according to the established, agreed upon, rules of business competition. In his infinite drive for profit, he will employ whatever means necessary without concern for the rights of others. OC can only heap scorn on the so-called \"citizen,\" the suckers, the working stiffs, those many who are outside their orbit and do not share their lifestyle.\n\n     Common criminality and OC do intersect. The line between the two is hazy as fringe elements have their roles to play. Many organized criminals begin as thieves and many organized crimes are little more than thievery. There are not two sets of violations that clearly distinguish the two worlds of criminality. But there are specific organizational and longevity characteristics. Thieves coming together to \"pull a job\" do not constitute a crime enterprise. They are not the same phenomenon as organized criminals dedicated to a continuity overtime of complex operations, a hierarchy of command, a variety of skills, and the cooperation of persons peripheral to the mob’s \"made members,\" who are often essential to a successful outcome. Organized criminals look for the ultimate \"big scores,\" and these require a substantial cash outlay, which only enterprises can muster.\n\n     Organized crime develops a mythology and a reputation in the community that is perceived by several publics—the mass media, the police, the justice and political systems—in such a manner to give an aura to OC often beyond the reality: it is invincible. The mafia is not all powerful and not all seeing, but affiliates turn these myths to their advantage to intimidate and threaten persons who will believe that behind a threat or scam stands a bunch of thugs who will otherwise get to you no matter where you hide. These perceptions form a brew of fact and fancy, where the two become inseparable and where the imagination can run riot over the power and presence of organized criminals.\n\n     This reputation can carry significant weight. It affects the way mafiosi see themselves and the way they are seen by others. The \"made member\" is more than an outlaw—he is a crazed killer, an institution admired by wannabes, sometimes a glamorous figure of stature in the community, the talk of the town, shrewd and cunning, who garners headlines and is capable of great harm to the body politic. A mafia \"hit\" is not a quotidian event as is the shooting of a street thug in the inner city. The \"hit\" signals an inner conflict within the crime family and authorities will ponder at length its purpose and consequences.\n\n     The increasingly complexity and scope of OC in modern society have made difficult the drafting of a definition of the phenomenon to which all parties can more or less agree and that takes into account the entirety of the phenomenon. Crime experts, politicians and other parties weighed in with their opinions. And opinions they remained until these secret societies began to crack open to the light of day with the confessions of an increasing number of informants. Those who turn state’s evidence have many reasons for doing so, including having little choice as they seek protection from their colleagues who wish them ill. Without such statements from those who have been on the inside, documentation of OC would be little more than a collection of myths. (The number of informants, as one example, from the Sicilian Cosa Nostra and the Neapolitan camorra increased from ten in 1992 to over 2000 in 1997. They decided to collaborate with the authorities, often after being arrested, furnishing information on the structure and activities of their organizations. In exchange, they received protection for themselves and their families, assistance payments and a reduction in time served.)\n\n     Let us look at some of the official definitions of OC. Among the Italian efforts is included in the Ragnoni-La Torre law of 1982. The fundamental element of the Italian OC involves the exercising of specific forms of economic and political pressure on the collectivity and selected individuals. \"An association is of the mafioso type when those who are affiliated members are part of a force of intimidation and are subject to the conditions of omertà, in order to commit crimes, acquire, directly or indirectly, companies or control such economic activity, of concessions, of authorizations, contracts and public services or realizing illegal profits or advantages to themselves or for others or to impede or block the free exercise of the vote or to procure votes to themselves or to others during occasions of electoral consultations.\" This definition must be understood within the context of the history of OC in Italy.\n\n     In the United States, the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, which includes the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, has no exact definition of OC. But the law recognized the reality of OC (especially in regard to Italo-American criminality) in the form of a \"pattern of racketeering activities\" committed during a continuous ten-year period, deriving profit from at least two or three crimes, that include—but not limited to—homicide, gambling, usury, narcotics trafficking and corruption. The concept of a \"pattern of racketeering activities\" can also apply to the infiltration of businesses and the utilization of derived funds.\n\n     The German Federal Police, Bundeskriminalamt, defines OC as the commission of planned crimes for the purpose of profit or power. Two or more persons must collaborate over a prolonged or indefinite period of time, each with a specific task to perform. The criminals must act through an organizational structure that employs violence or other means of intimidation to exercise an influence on politics, the media, the public administration, the justice system or the economy.\n\n     Any examination of the parameters of OC must also take into account the subculture of crime, the underworld, with its unique properties, which emanates, takes from and feeds upon, the society in which it is embedded. In previous decades that subculture in the United States was seen as composed primarily of Italian immigrants, who formed a conspiracy against America. This dominant model of OC—an interconnected group of criminal clans, holding fast to the traditional behavioral patterns of their Old World origins—suggested that OC was identified exclusively with a particular ethnic group, mainly the Sicilians. (In the 20s and 30s, the criminal stereotype became the dark-completed Sicilian mobster, the New York variety, which later was to be reinforced by the Italian immigrant gangster Apalachin meeting in upstate New York, in 1957, and once again on film (The Godfather), on television, and a spate of popular fiction and nonfiction, where the mob is an ever menacing backdrop. This simplified model, and certainly an outdated one, has served as a convenient explanation of the source of American OC, ignoring the obvious, that no group has ever held a monopoly on crime and corruption. Today, especially, OC is transnational, part and parcel of diverse ethnicities and cultures, necessitating more than one model, recognizing that the roots, faces and methods of crime are legion.\n\n     Transnational crime includes a variety of OC associations. Among these are the Columbian cartels, the Chinese Triads, the Japanese Yakuza, the Italian and Russian mafias, the Albanians and Montenegrins, and the Nigerians.\n\n     The relatively new Nigerian criminal menace is but one example demonstrating that the older mafia-model no longer holds. The emergence of Nigeria’s OC in the 1980s was a consequence of the collapse of prices of crude oil exports in an environment of a weak State apparatus and a culture of expediency and self-interest. (Nigeria has 35.9 billion barrels of proven petroleum reserves—the eight largest on earth.) Lawlessness has become the norm in large portions of Nigeria, at all levels, and that criminality has been exported abroad. In the words of journalist K. Maier in his book, This House Has Fallen, Nigeria is a \"criminally mismanaged corporation where the bosses are armed and have barricaded themselves inside the company safe.\"\n\n     The U.S. Department of Justice has called the epidemic of counterfeiting, corruption, credit card theft and other financial crimes the Nigerian Criminal Enterprises (NCEs) in recognition of the challenge to federal law enforcement. NCEs are organized and active in at least sixty countries around the world. They are adaptable, poly-crime organizations that bring new methods to old scams.\n\n     The NCEs do not fit the mold of criminals in the traditional crime syndicates. While a degree of structure is clearly identifiable within many of these networks, the relationships do not rival the organizational structure of Cosa Nostra or the Colombian and Mexican organized groups. The NCEs, from all appearances, tend to be less formal in structure, bonded by family and tribal loyalties but without a distinguishable hierarchical order and virtually impossible to penetrate by outsiders. Many Nigerian criminals are very flexible, innovative and brazen. They are freelancers and entrepreneurs, eager to embark on any illegal activity that shows promise. To add to the difficulty of police investigations, Nigeria has 75 distinct tribal languages.\n\n     Three kinds of Nigerian organizational structures have been suggested. The first is the traditional pyramidal hierarchy. At the top, the capos are often members of the elite and the government, who profit from activities that they coordinate and finance. They exploit the poorly implemented money laundering laws to protect the proceeds of crime that arrive from abroad.\n\n     The second type of structure is the flexible network of clan-type criminality based on family, tribal or friendship affinities. These clans operate within a larger network akin to the traditional mafia hierarchies in that they provide protection, a structural base and political connections.\n\n     The third model are the independent, self-contained cells, the freelancers, who take the initiative seeking out scams that often do not generate large profits.\n\n     According to the Department of Justice, \"Nigerian criminal groups are more pervasive around the globe than those of any other nation. The NCEs have exploited financial institutions, insurance companies, government entitlement programs, and individual citizens in the United States. Law enforcement officials in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, South Africa, Russia and other countries have also experienced high crime rates attributable to the Nigerian Criminal Enterprises.\"\n\n     The United States and Britain are the primary targets of the Nigerian criminals. Heroin trafficking is said to be second in volume only to the Chinese. Scams and frauds have brought in untold amounts of money from the gullible.\n\n     In 1999, U.S. victims reported several hundred million dollars of losses to Nigerian \"advance fee\" frauds. Mass mailings are sent out that tempt the unwary to accept a \"Confidential Business Proposal.\" Unclaimed and forgotten government funds, they are informed, can be yours if you send cash to grease some of the official palms in Nigeria or for the \"transfer tax\" needed prior to releasing the funds. This classic \"front-loaded\" or \"advance fee\" swindle is called the \"419 scam\" because of the statutory violation as stated in Nigerian law.\n\n     In 1997, Boston authorities arrested a ring of Nigerian check thieves who had stolen more than two billion dollars from Boston-area banks, law firms and a brokerage house. Checks were taken from the mail en route to a Boston financial institution.\n\n     The proceeds of such crimes are used to finance narcotics smuggling and distribution operations reaching from Thailand and Pakistan to major cities in the United States.",

Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received.\"He said the accident would not have happened if the pilot had followed the normal procedure for dealing with low fuel warnings.\n\nThe Pilot's Checklist stipulated that he should land the aircraft within 10 minutes of a fuel warning.\n\nThe sheriff described Capt Traill's failure to follow that procedure as \"inexplicable\".\n\nHe said: \"Capt Traill took a chance that the low fuel warnings he received were erroneous.\n\n\"That was a conscious decision on his part. It was a decision that had fatal consequences for 10 people.\"Sheriff Turnbull also said that the Eurocopter EC135, manufactured by Airbus, should have had a visible and audible warning which would activate when both fuel transfer pumps had been switched off.\n\nThe pumps, which were both switched off during the flight, supplied fuel from the main tank to the helicopter's twin engines.\n\nSheriff Turnbull said: \"The circumstances of the accident are so unusual that it is improbable they will be repeated, even without the introduction of the safety actions taken since the accident.\"\n\nHe added that the tragedy \"changed forever the lives of many people\" and praised the dignity of those who attended the 32-day inquiry.Sheriff Turnbull noted it was \"surprising\" that it took two years from the 2015 publication of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report on the crash to confirm that there would be no criminal proceedings.\n\nHe added: \"It took far too long to lodge a notice of inquiry in this case.\"\n\nSheriff Turnbull also said the Crown Office's Helicopter Incidents Investigation Team were \"not sufficiently resourced\" to enable the FAI to start sooner.\n\nHe added that an FAI into the deaths caused by the Sumburgh helicopter crash in August 2013 was still to be held.\n\n'Deeply saddened'\nA Crown Office spokesperson said: \"This was an exceptionally complex and challenging investigation and the Crown acknowledges that the time taken from the tragedy occurring to convening the inquiry was longer than desirable, and that this compounded the distress suffered by bereaved relatives.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said additional funding had been made available to recruit additional staff, and that improvements were being made.\n\nA spokesman for the aircraft's manufacturer, Airbus Helicopters, said it was \"deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the heavy loss of life\".\n\n\"We took immediate action to understand the root cause and we have taken note of the findings of both the AAIB and FAI,\" he said.\n\n\"The safety of our fleet remains our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything possible to ensure the safe operation of our helicopters.\"\n\nClutha timeline29 November 2013: A police helicopter crashes onto the Clutha bar in Glasgow, killing 10 people\n9 December 2013: AAIB preliminary report finds no evidence of a \"major\" engine or gearbox failure, and says there was 95 litres of fuel on board the aircraft\n14 February 2014: An AAIB special report finds both engines \"flamed out\" but does not pinpoint the cause\n23 October 2015: The AAIB's final report finds the main cause of accident to be mismanagement of the fuel system by the pilot\n24 November 2017: Fatal accident inquiry announced\n8 April 2019: Fatal accident inquiry begins at Hampden Stadium in Glasgow",

    "content": "TOKYO — The head of the Tokyo Olympics resigned Friday after a scandal over sexist remarks he made about women threatened to overshadow preparations for the pandemic-hit games.\n\n“As of today I will resign from the president's position,” Yoshiro Mori said to open a meeting of the Olympic Committee's executive board and council.\n\nIt was unclear who would succeed him.\n\nMori's departure comes after outcry both at home and abroad after he reportedly said women talk too much and have a “strong sense of rivalry” during a board meeting earlier this month.\n\nAfter a wave of criticism, Mori, 83, apologized and retracted his remarks, acknowledging they were inappropriate and against the Olympic spirit.\n\nHe apologized again Friday as he announced he was stepping down. \"My inappropriate comments caused big trouble. I am sorry,\" he said.\n\nMori added that he felt his comments were misinterpreted by the media and that he was not prejudiced against women.\n\n“The IOC fully respects President Mori’s decision to step down and understands his reasons for doing so,\" its president, Thomas Bach, said in a statement later Friday.\n\n\"The IOC will continue working hand-in-hand with his successor to deliver safe and secure Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 in 2021.”\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nThe saga has dealt a fresh blow to the embattled games, already marred by fears around the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPostponed because of Covid-19 last year, the Tokyo Games organizers are now trying to convince the world that they can ensure a safe environment for thousands of athletes and fans.\n\nAlthough Japan has not suffered virus outbreaks on the scale of other major economies, such as the United States and Britain, it recently extended its state of emergency in Tokyo and other regions by another month.\n\nThe country of 126 million reported its worst one-day death toll for the pandemic Thursday with 121 new deaths and has also yet to start mass vaccinations.\n\nCovid-19 aside, the organizing committee has also been grappling with ballooning costs and dwindling enthusiasm among the Japanese public, with nearly 80 percent saying the Olympics should be canceled or further delayed — all against the backdrop of a sudden change in leadership in the country after the departure of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last summer.\n\n“Japan's staging of the Tokyo Games was supposed to be about the country changing, turning outwards, reforming and projecting a more contemporary image,” said Simon Chadwick, sports academic and director of the Center for the Eurasian Sport Industry at the Emlyon Business School in France.\n\n“However, it has been a case of triple-whammy for Japan: first the pandemic, then Abe leaving office due to illness and now Mori's resignation. Things could hardly have been worse than the situation Tokyo now faces.”\n\nFollowing Mori’s remarks, hundreds of Olympic volunteers have quit and local organizers have received thousands of complaints, according to local media.\n\nJapan’s Olympic tennis hopeful, Naomi Osaka, said his comments were “really ignorant” and Olympic champion swimmer Kosuke Hagino called them “very unfortunate.”\n\nSeveral sponsors also voiced concerns.\n\nThe controversy has also put the spotlight on the sexism and gender equality that still linger among Japan's conservative, male-dominated elites.\n\nThe issue has dominated parliamentary sessions for days with the opposition urging the country’s government to take action against Mori, a former prime minister himself. A group of female opposition lawmakers wore white, in homage to the women's suffrage movement, with roses on their lapels in protest of Mori’s remarks.\n\nJapan trails other developed nations in promoting gender equality. It stands 121st out of 153 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2020 gender gap index, which highlights gender-based disparities around the world.\n\nJapan’s gender gap is by far the largest among all advanced economies and has widened over the past year, the index said, with only 15 percent of senior and leadership positions held by women.\n\nAlthough the younger generation is more socially progressive and more sensitive to gender equality issues, social practices are slower to change and Japan lags behind — especially in the absence of female representation in leadership positions, said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Tokyo’s Sophia University.\n\n“This is precisely why Mori’s comments were so strongly rejected by the public,” he added.\n\n“The Japanese are often reluctant to take positions on issues that are seen as political, but the negative reaction was practically unanimous on this one,” Nakano said.\n\nBut while Mori’s comments and resignation are yet another crisis that the Tokyo Games organizers have to tackle, it will likely get lost in the legacy of the Olympics faced with a pandemic, said Heather Dichter, an associate professor of sports management and sport history at the De Montfort University in the United Kingdom.\n\n“The biggest thing that people will always talk about is how they have dealt with the pandemic,\" Dichter said.\n\n“That will be what people will remember these games for.”\n\nArata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Yuliya Talmazan reported from London.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.",

The version of the system aboard Boxer was mounted on an MRZR that was perched on the bow of the ship and was powered by a gasoline electrical generator, according to photos released from the service. The Marine Corps did not immediately respond to a request for additional information on the system.\n\nThe encounter is the first known kill by a new generation of electronic warfare and directed energy weapons the U.S. has developed over the last decade to handle the daunting problem of how to counter voluminous, low-end threats without resorting wasting high-dollar missiles, naval analyst and retired Navy officer Thomas Callender told USNI News on Friday.\n\nIn particular, both the Navy and Marines have been concerned about swarms of cheap but lethal unmanned vehicles that could overwhelm a ship or ground unit’s defenses.\n\nIt’s a tricky problem. Defenses on U.S. warships are optimized for the high-end threats, and firing expensive missiles to intercept a drone that’s a fraction of that cost puts Americans at a cost disadvantage.\n\nFor example, Boxer fields short-range RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles that cost about $170,000 each and the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile that costs shy of a million dollars apiece. Either, or a combination of both, would have likely been used to down the Iranian drone on Thursday if the Marine’s MADIS wasn’t sitting on Boxer‘s deck, USNI News understands.\n\nThe Navy has tested less expensive options at sea to shoot down drones, trying its 5-inch deck guns as well as the Phalanx Close-in Weapons Systems with limited success.\n\n“They found that the 5-inch gun took multiple shots to try and hit it because it’s not designed for something slow and small,” Callender said. “Even with the CIWS, it took a lot of shots to take that out.”\n\nThose types engagement still costs thousands of dollars in rounds, on a ship at sea with a limited supply of ammunition.With systems like MADIS, “now you’re, back on the right side of that costs exchange ratio,” Callender said, “instead of spending hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars on a missile or a higher-end weapon against something that’s very low-end, low-cost.”\n\nIn 2014, the Navy deployed a 30-kilowatt laser aboard a ship in the Persian Gulf as an early test of a directed energy weapon at sea after it proved it could disable small boats and UAVs. Then-Office of Naval Research chief Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder highlighted the cost of firing the laser – about a dollar a shot.\n\nThe Navy is moving to install its first 60-kilowatt Lockheed Martin-built High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance (HELIOS) directed energy weapon on a destroyer in 2021. The Navy is also working on additional electronic warfare capabilities on its surface ships that could find non-kinetic ways to disable enemy missiles and UAVs. In January, Northrop Grumman won a contract to develop the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block III electronic attack capability for U.S. warships.\n\nIn addition to the lower cost of operating the systems and an ammunition supply only limited by the energy a vehicle or ship can generate, Callender said there were other benefits to the new systems.\n\nUsing systems like MADIS is “less escalatory than if you shot a missile,” he said.\n“And in some ways, depending on the scenario, you could have deniability. ‘Oh, it crashed. We don’t know why it crashed.’”",

They have accused him of keeping his wife in the palace and out of the media's reach - because of fears he will be criticized by conservative religious leaders.\n\nYet the changes for girls are clear on a visit to the Suriya school in Kabul.Many of the girls here were born around the time American bombs were falling on Afghanistan in 2001, so they have no memory of the tough years before.\n\nIn the yard outside, the girls' cricket team is practising under the tutelage of a male coach - unimaginable under the Taliban - who only allowed women to venture out with a close male relative.\n\nA UK charity, Afghan Connection, has been helping, providing equipment donated by British schools.\n\nLondon's Marylebone Cricket Club is also giving support.\n\nInconsistency\nSafe within the walls of their school, they are like children anywhere, curious about their visitors and keen to talk about themselves.\"I want to be a journalist too,\" says one 12-year-old, when they find out who these visitors are.\n\nBut outside Kabul and other big cities the changes are more patchy.\n\nMost Afghans still live in rural areas, where poverty, conflict and conservative attitudes are more likely to keep girls and women at home.\n\nOf the 4.2 million Afghan children not getting any education, Unicef estimates 60% are girls - and most live in rural districts and the southern and eastern provinces where Nato-Taliban clashes have been most fierce.\n\nThese are also the heartlands of the Pashtuns, the ethnic group from which the Taliban emerged and who have always had the most conservative views of a woman's role.\n\nMore schools are being built outside Afghan cities - but far less in this conflict belt. Even then, the Taliban have forced many to close again.\n\nIt's dangerous trying to be a teacher in southern Afghanistan.\n\nUS withdrawal\nThere's some anxiety too over whether the momentum of change for Afghan girls will last once the Americans pull out in 2014.\n\nAfghanistan's Education Minister Farooq Wardak - a possible future presidential candidate - insists it will.\n\nAt an opening ceremony for a new school in much safer Bamyan, he says only when women feel they are \"the owner of this nation... can we make Afghanistan\".\n\nAfghan Connection has funded the construction of more than 30 schools and is encouraging the focus on rural areas.\n\nDirector Dr Sarah Fayne says the key is winning acceptance, \"making sure schools are close to where people live, so girls don't have to walk far and that they have female teachers\".\n\nBut she's convinced the changes of the past decade are now permanent.\n\n\"I can't believe people who have let their kids go to school will allow that to be taken away.\"\n\nBack in her Bamyan village, Hamida still has a lot of work to do in the family home, helping look after her younger siblings as well as in the fields.\n\nBut six days a week now, she makes the 2km walk uphill to her local school perched on a mountainside.\n\n\"There was no school in my time,\" says her mother - only 30 years old.\n\n\"My daughter wants to be a doctor. May God help us, so her dreams come true.\"",

    "content": "TORONTO (Reuters) - A key supplier of the chemicals needed to test for coronavirus, France's Biomérieux BIOX.PA, has given its proprietary formula to the Canadian government for free so its national lab can try to manufacture badly-needed test kits on its own, according to federal officials and a note to customers obtained by Reuters.\n\n\nThe unusual deal shows Ottawa’s determination to scale up testing, a key step towards relaxing strict public health measures that have disrupted daily life and tanked economies around the world.\n\nIn March, Canada passed emergency legislation that gave the government and third parties it designates the right to produce patented goods without the patent holders’ consent. Doing that could have been technically difficult, without a company’s formula.\n\nWhile there is no indication that Canada forced Biomerieux to agree to the license, the option was available.\n\nBiomérieux did not respond to questions about whether it had made similar arrangements with any other governments, or the revenue impact of the agreement.\n\nIt reported a 21.5% increase in sales in the first quarter, thanks in part to demand for reagent.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) described the arrangement as a temporary license that allows the government to manufacture Biomérieux products used for coronavirus testing. It did not say whether it threatened to use the new law, and said the license was signed “at no cost.”\n\nPHAC said its manufacturing was still in “development and testing” and its goal was to alleviate shortages soon.\n\nIn its email to customers in early April, Biomérieux’s Canadian unit said the move was meant to clear up testing backlogs, an indication of the stress in the supply chain that makes testing possible. The company said it was also boosting its own production.\n\nThe chemicals in short supply, also called reagents, are used to extract RNA, the virus’s genetic material, from patient samples. A handful of companies make most RNA extraction equipment and sell reagent kits made for their own machines, a bit like inkjet printer cartridges.\n\nOther major suppliers are Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.N acquisition target Qiagen and Roche ROG.S. All are facing soaring demand, as public health workers around the world race to find people who could be spreading the virus.\n\n“We hope that in the near future, this move will allow federal and provincial labs to test more Canadians, thus reducing testing backlogs,” Biomerieux said in its customer note.\n\n“This private-public collaboration signals that unprecedented times, require unprecedented solutions.” Biomérieux extraction equipment is widely used in Canada.\n\nIts machines were the primary system used by Ontario’s public health labs, and heavy reliance on one brand contributed to a testing slowdown in late March. Biomérieux equipment is also widely used in Quebec, according to the provincial government.\n\nPHAC said the deal is an “interim solution”, because its facilities are not meant to be used for long-term manufacturing.\n\nOn Thursday, Canada pledged C$1.1 billion ($782 million) for research and drug or vaccine manufacturing in its fight against the coronavirus.",

    "content": "Santiago, Chile – Looting and arson, attacks against police stations and police vehicles, the destruction of an ambulance, accompanied by daily protests that almost inevitably end in clashes with security forces – are making many Chileans feel that public security is out of control.\n\nThat feeling was underscored late last month when President Sebastian Pinera addressed the nation, saying he was sending an urgent bill to Congress that requests the army be allowed to safeguard key installations and police stations without the need to declare a state of emergency.The government says that an about one-third of the estimated $1.5bn worth of destruction since protests began on October 18, was caused by criminal gangs, common criminals, drug traffickers and anarchists.\n\nBut this does not explain where the rest of the violent reactions on the streets. One thing that is obvious just by reading the enormous amount of graffiti here in Santiago is that many people feel enraged.\n\n“Accumulate fury,” reads one message, “keep going until dignity becomes normal,” says another, “make the cuicos (the rich) shiver.”\n\nFor the vast majority, the anger over social exclusion and inequality has been expressed without violence. But there is another, increasingly more visible group, that believes that the only way to guarantee the economic and political changes that Chileans are demanding, requires violence.\n\n“Those stupid demonstrations and marches that peaceful protesters have been carrying out for 30 years have achieved nothing,” says a protester who requested to be referred to as Mario, not his real name.\n\nHe is a 25-year-old father of a toddler who had just lost his job as an assistant accountant on the day we met him and his “comrade in the struggle”, 23-year-old Maria, also not her real name.\n\nThey live in La Pintana, a poor working-class neighbourhood located on the outskirts of south Santiago, an area with high unemployment, low-income jobs, substandard social services and drug trafficking.    \n\nAfter some coaxing, they agreed to talk to me.\n\n“We need to shake the elite our of their comfort zone. We need them to feel fear. That is the only way to force them to take action,” says Maria.\n\n“The rich and powerful are the ones who’ve thrown the first stone. They discriminate against us, despise us, leave us without education and healthcare. That’s much more violent than destroying a bus, throwing stones or writing graffiti on a wall.”\n\nMaria and Mario represent a degree of anger, frustration and class resentment that many better off Chileans never thought existed in a country that up until October, was widely considered one of Latin America’s success stories.  Maria Olga is a professional who says she has worked hard all of her life to be able to live comfortably in one of Santiago’s upper-middle-class neighbourhoods.\n\n“Those people who are causing so much destruction can’t be Chileans, I don’t recognise this country,” she says.\n\nMaria and Mario say that this is because they have been invisible for decades.\n\nBut while they describe themselves as “radical opponents of the system”, they insist that it has nothing to do with left- or right-wing ideology. In fact, they underscore that those who are throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, and even helping to distribute the spoils of looted supermarkets, have no political affiliation.\n\n“We aren’t asking for their jewels or gold, only basic things like a decent income for workers and basic services,” Maria says.\n\n“When I see my mother taking my grandparents to the hospital day after day without being able to get treatment, when I see the huge differences in the standard of living between those who live in the slums and those who live uptown, in an oasis, it infuriates me to see so much injustice. We have to work three times harder just for crumbs,” she adds.\n\nA new study shows that 58 percent of Chileans belong to the lower-middle-class or the so-called “vulnerable class” of people who cannot access their basic needs under the country’s current system.\n\nIt is a system that is widely criticised for favouring the needs of the market above those of citizens.\n\nApart from anger, the perception that unites many of the so-called “radicals” in the country is a deep distrust of Chile’s political institutions, as well as the political elite. And this explains why for many protesters, the government and the political parties’ attempts to create a new social contract to quell the unrest, is falling on deaf ears.\n\n“Many of us don’t believe in voting. I don’t feel represented by any of the parties. If there was someone who would fight for our rights, then maybe yes. But they have lied so much,” Mario says.",

He heads the project CoronaDX, in which researchers develop three new measuring instruments capable of performing fast on-site diagnosis of coronavirus.\n\nProject partner, Professor and Chief of Virus R&D Anders Fomsgaard from Statens Seruminstitut (SSI) also continues on working because two out of the three instruments are scheduled to be ready for emergency use in October, when the next wave of COVID-19 is expected to hit Denmark. The third instrument is scheduled to be ready in March 2021.Several research teams are working on a vaccine, but it will be 1-2 years at best before it is approved for use. In the meantime, it is essential to develop technology able to quickly separate healthy people from infected people, thereby delaying the spread of the virus as much as possible.\n\nTaking the pressure off hospitals\n\nThe fastest instrument will give the diagnosis in less than one minute. The slowest in less than an hour. All three instruments are being designed to be very easy to use – much like a pregnancy test. They can, therefore, be used in clinics or at home and provide an immediate diagnosis. This enables on-site testing, which saves both time and resources related to transportation and analysis, thereby decreasing the pressure on the central test laboratories. The risk of hospital staff being infected is also reduced, as the infected can be quarantined immediately.\n\nQuarantine-affected persons will also be able to get an immediate diagnosis. If they are not infected, they can then resume their normal lives and work right away. That means more working people to keep the country running as normally as possible during an epidemic.Professor Anders Fomsgaard from Statens Serum Institut is responsible for the development of two of the instruments, including the fastest one that gives the result in less than one minute. He is certain that the speed and ease of use of the new instruments could increase the effectiveness of the healthcare system’s response to any future epidemics:\n\n“A quick simple test easy to perform and without significant costs to the person, can become a new tool for diagnosing disease, infection potential and prompt recovery notification. The technique can be used in a wide range of other viral diseases in patients who are best diagnosed outside of hospitals. ”\n\n” In October, we expect to have a permit for emergency use in Denmark and thus be ready for the possible second wave of coronavirus.”\n\nRapid development\n\nUnder normal conditions, such a development would take several years, and Professor Anders Wolff from DTU Bioengineering, who heads the project, says that this project is developing unusually fast:\n\n“It’s quite clear that the research community is acutely aware that this is a very special and serious situation, and we work together as colleagues across countries and organizations rather than as competitors. That is why there are so many publicly available RNA sequences for COVID-19, and that is one of the reasons we are able to work as fast as we currently do.”\n\nThe three new instruments measure in three different ways in order to recognize the virus, and the technology itself is the absolutely newest in the field. The researches themselves have very recently developed it in another EU funded project aimed at detecting diseases in poultry. Ander Wolff elaborates:\n\n“The measuring instrument itself is ready. What we need to do now is to develop new reagents—that is, the substance that must react with the virus and thus show whether a person is infected. The epidemic is so serious that our research is covered by emergency regulations, which is why we are allowed to test our equipment in the field at a much earlier stage than usual. As early as June, our two Chinese partners will test two of the instruments in the field in China. In October, we expect to have a permit for emergency use in Denmark and thus be ready for the possible second wave of coronavirus.”\n\nSource: DTU",

A second British vessel was given a verbal warning.The action signaled France’s determination not to back down in the row, a day after listing potential sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/brexit-france-readying-sanctions-if-uk-withholds-fishing-licenses-2021-10-27 against Britain if there is no progress in talks.\n\nThey include extra customs checks on British goods from Nov. 2 and what was widely seen in London as a threat to cut electricity exports to Britain if talks fail.\n\n“It’s not war, but it is a fight,” Girardin told RTL radio.\n\nBritish fishing grounds are among the richest in the North East Atlantic zone, where most of the European Union’s catch is hauled in.\n\nFrance’s actions appear intended as a warning shot to put pressure on Britain to compromise at talks with the EU.The British government said the French reaction was “disappointing and disproportionate, and not what we would expect from a close ally and partner.”\n\nEnvironment minister George Eustice challenged France’s statement that the boat had no license, and told parliament the steps threatened by France appeared to be incompatible with a post-Brexit free-trade agreement and wider international law.\n\n.”..if carried through, (they) will be met with an appropriate and calibrated response,” he said.\n\nFrance says Britain has refused to grant its fishermen the full number of licenses to operate in British waters that France says is warranted, though Britain says it is issuing licenses to vessels that meet its criteria.“So now we need to speak the language of strength since that seems to be the only thing this British government understands,” European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune told CNews television channel.\n\nGirardin made clear France could not cut off electricity supplies to Britain as a retaliatory measure but said it could raise tariffs. Britain was importing about 6% of its electricity supply from France on Thursday, data showed.\n\nVESSEL IMPOUNDED\n\nAdditional customs checks on goods traveling between Britain and the rest of Europe could disrupt trade flows before Christmas.\n\nThe EU’s executive body said it would continue talks with Britain and France in the coming days.\n\nThe Cornelis Gert Jan’s skipper is under preliminary investigation for dredging 2,160 kg (4,762 lb) of scallops and could face a 75,000-euro ($87,500 fine). Its owners said the vessel had a fishing license and had been fishing legally.“We are a pawn of bigger forces here. This is to do with licenses and the beef that the French have with the licenses of French vessels,” Andrew Brown, a director of Macduff Shellfish, told Reuters.\n\nBarrie Deas, head of Britain’s National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said France appeared determined to escalate the license row before a presidential election, with President Emmanuel Macron expected to seek a new term in April.\n\nIn a sign Britain might offer more licenses, Bruno Margolle, head of the Boulogne fishermen’s collective, said 15 of the 37 license requests from his region previously shown as rejected had passed to ‘under consideration’ since the boat was held.\n\nSenior British, French and EU officials have signaled they do not want the dispute to escalate, but Macron and Johnson are under pressure from vocal fishing lobbies and will want to show they are defending voters’ interests.The industry makes only a small contribution to the French and British economies but is a lifeline for some coastal communities.\n\nIn Le Havre, scallop fishermen said they were fed up with British vessels enjoying what they called unfair access to shellfish in French waters.\n\n“There has to be an end to this fraud,” Pascal Coquet, president of the National Scallop Fishermen’s Committee, said. ($1 = 0.8566 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Juliette Jabkhiro in Le Havre; Sudip Kar-Gupta, Richard Lough, Michaela Cabrera and Layli Foroudi in Paris; Hilip Blenkinsop in Brussels and Andrew MacAskill and Kylie MacLellan in London; Writing by Richard Lough and Timothy Heritage; Editing by Catherine Evans and Nick Macfie)",

As of today, the total number of days spent on-orbit for the entire test vehicle program is 2,865 days.\n\n“The X-37B continues to demonstrate the importance of a reusable spaceplane,” said Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett. “Each successive mission advances our nation’s space capabilities.”\n\nThis is the Air Force’s premier reusable and unmanned spacecraft, providing the performance and flexibility to improve technologies in a way that allows scientists and engineers to recover experiments tested in a long-duration space environment.\n\n“The safe return of this spacecraft, after breaking its own endurance record, is the result of the innovative partnership between government and industry,” said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein. “The sky is no longer the limit for the Air Force and, if Congress approves, the U.S. Space Force.”\n\nManaged by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, the X-37B program performs risk reduction, experimentation and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies.\n\n“This program continues to push the envelope as the world’s only reusable space vehicle. With a successful landing today, the X-37B completed its longest flight to date and successfully completed all mission objectives,” said Randy Walden, Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office director. “This mission successfully hosted Air Force Research Laboratory experiments, among others, as well as providing a ride for small satellites.”\n\nThe distinctive ability to test new systems in space and return them to Earth is unique to the X-37B program and enables the U.S. to more efficiently and effectively develop space capabilities necessary to maintain superiority in the space domain.\n\n“This spacecraft is a key component of the space community. This milestone demonstrates our commitment to conducting experiments for America’s future space exploration,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Keen, X-37B program manager. “Congratulations to the X-37B team for a job well done.”\n\nThis will be the second time the X-37B landed at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility — Mission 4 landed after 718 days in orbit. The spaceplane was designed for an on-orbit duration of 270 days.\n\n“Today marks an incredibly exciting day for the 45th Space Wing,” said Brig. Gen. Doug Schiess, 45th Space Wing commander. “Our team has been preparing for this event, and I am extremely proud to see their hard work and dedication culminate in today’s safe and successful landing of the X-37B.”\n\nThe fifth mission launched on Sept. 7, 2017, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on-board a Space X Falcon 9 booster, and the Air Force is preparing to launch the sixth X-37B mission from CCAFS in 2020.",

    "content": "The killing of a loved one. An attempt at gang recruitment. A rape. Harassment by a police officer. A death threat over an outstanding extortion payment. Amid the justified uproar at the Trump administration’s policies on America’s southern border, often lost are the reasons many Central Americans leave their homes, and are prepared to brave the perils of the journey north, in the first place. Families arriving at the border from countries like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala leave behind a myriad of stories, many of them connected to their homelands’ plague of armed violence.\n\nHistorically, Central Americans have tended to migrate for economic reasons. Since the end of the internal armed conflicts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua—which together displaced almost 2 million people in the 1970s and 1980s—thousands of Central Americans travelled to the U.S. to escape economic misery in their war-torn states. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the U.S. saw record numbers of apprehensions of migrants along its border with Mexico.\n\nToday’s migrant flow is very different. Yes, there are still male heads of household seeking to pursue the “American Dream” in the U.S. so as to send home a couple of hundred dollars each month to their families. But the crux of the recent crisis at the border is that there are fewer male migrants in their 20s or 30s making the crossing, and many more families, newborns, children, and pregnant women escaping life-or-death situations as much as poverty.\n\nPrevious U.S. policies contributed to the extreme insecurity in their home countries. In 1996, U.S. authorities approved the “Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act,” which led to the deportations of tens of thousands of convicted criminals to Central America in the early 2000s. This in turn led to the expansion of gangs like the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the 18th Street gang (Barrio 18)—originally born in the U.S.—across El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\n\nThe region’s civil wars left behind tens of thousands of young people from broken families. That reality, combined with extreme inequality, policies of mass incarceration of suspicious youth, and weak judicial and security institutions created the new monster that is today’s gang problem. Over the past 15 years, they have taken over both rural and urban areas across North Central America, setting up roadblocks in poor neighborhoods and imposing their own law. While poverty remains the principal cause of Central American families traveling north, desperation to escape gang violence also motivates many.\n\nIn countries like El Salvador and Honduras, parents living in what are popularly known as “red zones”—usually communities plagued by gangs—have to spend hard-earned money on private transport or after-school programs to avoid their kids coming into contact with criminal groups. “It’s really complicated for us [the parents] ... because we need to work more hours to pay for the security of our children and also spend enough time at home to talk with them and make sure they are not hanging out with the wrong people,” a Honduran social worker and mother of two told me recently. I am withholding her name, and those of others quoted in this story, for security reasons.For some families, it is too late to keep their kids away. In El Salvador, where there are around 65,000 thousand active gang members with a social support base of half a million people, boys from 12 years up are prime targets for recruitment. Girls can also be targeted at an early age, either to be sexually abused or to become gang members. The eventual fate of a girl—whether she is left alone, harassed into joining the gang, or forced into becoming a sex slave—depends entirely on the local leaders, or palabreros, who run the local cells or clicas (cliques) of the two largest gangs, MS-13 and Barrio 18.\n\nThe recruitment process is gradual and lasts from a couple of months to a few years. It can start with a present from the local gang, such as expensive sportswear or an invitation to come to a party in a casa loca (literally ‘mad house’), with sex workers included. If you spend enough time with internally displaced people in Central America, more than one will tell you that their old homes became one of these casas locas because the gang wanted it “for strategic purposes” in their turf wars with other groups. If a family refuses to leave, all its members are threatened.\n\nDespite decades-long prevention efforts by local authorities and foreign-backed law enforcement, gangs remain defiant and undefeated. The phenomenon has grown so rapidly since the 2000s that it has penetrated deep into the social fabric of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, meaning police operations alone aren’t enough to defeat the gangs. Top state officials in the region are aware of the magnitude of what they face, and behind closed doors agree that they are “fighting a war they cannot win.”\n\nNevertheless, the governments from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras continue to rely almost solely on security crackdowns to tackle gangs. This has indirectly created yet another reason for the local population to flee. As an NGO worker in El Salvador told me recently: “The situation is so bad that sometimes people are more scared of the police than the gangs.”\n\nWhile law enforcement is an inevitable part of the fight against violent crime, the impact in communities where gangs are present can be hugely counter-productive. Especially in El Salvador and Honduras, residents get caught in daily armed confrontations caused by gangs’ turf wars, as well as operations by security forces in their communities to combat them. This is on top of the usual harassment that the gangs inflict on local families, like trying to recruit their children or extracting weekly extortion payments. “In my previous neighborhood I couldn’t trust anybody, it is like not knowing who the enemy is,” a man displaced from his community in central Honduras by gang violence told me when I met him in Tegucigalpa. In El Salvador, it is very common that teenagers living in “red zones” are harassed by security forces, who consider them usual suspects of gang membership.\n\nThis situation has left thousands of Central American families stuck between a rock and a hard place. They know how dangerous the trip to the U.S. is, but are forced to leave to save their lives. “If I stay here, I will die,” a Honduran woman told me in tears during a group interview with victims of forced displacement in Tegucigalpa. Her fear was retaliation from gangs after her son and mother had been killed in the same week.\n\nWhen I have asked displaced people over the past few months if U.S. migration policies deter them from fleeing, they usually reply that the prospect of being caught by U.S. migration officials makes them anxious, but that “there is no scarier place” than their home countries. This is why, no matter how hard and sometimes inhumane this administration’s anti-immigration policies might be, many Central American parents and their children will be determined to make the trip north anyway.\n\nMany don’t leave much behind, not even their houses. This is why, as a friend from Guatemala who once considered making the trip recently told me, they are still willing to go through the perilous journey: “We know you can get killed, and how dangerous it is especially for women [to try entering the U.S. without papers] ... but when it’s a life or death situation, I bet you would do the same.”\n\nSofía Martínez is an analyst for the International Crisis Group based in Guatemala, covering criminal violence, politics, and humanitarian issues in Central America.",

    "content": "Updated at 12:22 a.m. ET on Sunday\n\nThree people have died after a quick-moving wildfire churned through the foothills of Southern California. As firefighters worked to tamp down largely contained blazes, evacuation orders were lifted in all of Los Angeles County and in parts of Riverside County, where a second fire raged.\n\nThe Los Angeles blaze, which officials have named the Saddleridge Fire, ignited late Thursday, destroying more than 30 structures. It began in the northernmost Los Angeles County neighborhood of Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nAs of Saturday night local time, the fire torched more than 7,900 acres and is 33% contained, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti had issued emergency declarations Friday. Newsom said in a statement the state secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency \"to help ensure the availability of resources to fight the Saddleridge Fire.\"\n\nGarcetti, tweeted an image of him signing paperwork that would ensure agencies \"take all the necessary steps to protect lives and property threatened by this fire.\"\n\nAt least 31 structures have been damaged and more property assessments are planned. Of the affected structures, 13 of them were completely destroyed, according to the latest alert by the LAFD.\n\nMore than 1,000 firefighters were assigned to combat the fire, including personnel from the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Fire Department and United States Forest Service.\n\n\"This is a very dynamic fire,\" Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said at a Friday news conference.\n\nStrong Santa Ana winds, coupled with the area's dry chaparral landscape, have helped fuel the fire. The flames have forced the closure of several miles of the 118 and 210 freeways. Officials say the fire started out about 1 acre in size, but soon morphed into a wind-driven fire that \"quickly pushed across Sylmar.\"\n\nEvacuation orders affected communities on both sides of Interstate 5, including neighborhoods like Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, which were also evacuated.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Saturday that wind gusts were weaker than in previous days, but added that \"single digit humidities and warm temperatures will still result in Red Flag Warnings\" across the Los Angeles region.\n\nJacob Margolis of NPR member station KPCC described the scene from a staging area for first responders at Hansen Dam, not far from the fire line.\n\n\"There are bulldozers, trailers,\" Margolis told NPR's Morning Edition on Friday.\n\n\"Really everyone is just trying to coordinate and figure out how to tackle the fires, especially before they creep into the neighborhood. And they've been doing that all night,\" he said.\n\nLocal officials say 276 minors at the Barry J. Nidorf juvenile detention center in Sylmar were evacuated earlier in the day to another facility approximately 40 miles away in Downey.\n\n\"It was done out of an abundance of caution,\" said Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors member Kathryn Barger at an afternoon news conference.\n\nShe also said Olive View Hospital is currently under a shelter-in-place order, but patients at a nearby urgent care center for mental health were evacuated and patients were moved to the main hospital.\n\nEmergency officials say one civilian went into cardiac arrest and died at the hospital, and one firefighter sustained a minor injury to his eye. The officials did not provide details about those cases.\n\nNo cause of the fire has been determined.\n\nTerrazas said emergency officials received the first reports of the fire around 9 p.m. Thursday.Earlier in the week PG&E, the state's largest utility, began proactively shutting off power to roughly 800,000 customers in Northern and Central California, impacting nearly 2.5 million people, according to one estimate.\n\nNPR's Emma Bowman contributed to this report.\n\n\"Our first arriving companies reported significant fire with multiple homes threatened,\" Terrazas said. \"We went into an aggressive offensive attack while simultaneously setting up our structure protection.\"\n\nEast of Los Angeles, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department say what officials are referring to as the Sandalwood Fire was 68% contained at roughly 1,000 acres on Saturday night. Two people have been found dead at the charred site of the blaze at a mobile home park in Calimesa. An evacuation order remains in place at the Villa Calimesa Mobile Home Park, where at least 74 structures have been destroyed.For days, California utility companies have been preemptively cutting off power out of fear that high wind gusts could blow power lines into trees, sparking dangerous fires.\n\nOn Friday, Southern California Edison cut off power to more than 21,000 customers under its Public Safety Power Shutdown in Kern, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. As of Saturday evening, that number was down to 54 customers, according to the utility.\n\nThe fire raised concerns that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Porter Ranch might cause another gas leak like the one that spewed methane into the air in 2015 and 2016. Last year, the company reached a $119.5 million settlement with several government entities over the leak.\n\nOn Friday, SoCalGas tweeted: \"No indications of damage or leaks at the facility.\"",

    "content": "According to a new study, the megatooth shark Otodus megalodon was the largest shark to ever swim in our planet’s oceans. O. megalodon is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago. The exact cause of its extinction is still debated, likely a combination of environmental change and competition with smaller shark species played a role.\n\nDespite its fame in pop-culture, surprisingly little is known about the life-appearance of the megalodon. Sharks have a cartilaginous skeleton that will quickly decay after death. Only their hard teeth survive the fossilization process. A recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports discussing the body size of O. megalodon, concluded that a full-grown specimen could reach about 50 feet (or 15 meters) in length. A new study published in the journal Historical Biology shows how unique the size of this species was.Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago and lead author of the study, compiled a database of 70 shark species and they inferred size based on their fossil record. The study used measurements taken from specimens of all 13 species of present-day macrophagous (non-planktivorous) sharks to generate mathematical functions describing the proportion relationships between teeth dimensions, jaw length, and body size. Applying the functions to fossil teeth, the researchers reconstructed the body size distribution of extinct shark species over geologic time.\n\nThe study shows that non-planktivorous sharks, including extinct forms, have a general size limit of 23 feet (7 meters). Only a few present-day plankton-eating sharks, like the whale shark and basking shark, can reach lengths of 26 to 32 feet (8 to 10 meters). The study also shows that sharks got on average bigger in the last 65 million years. Even so, with a maximum size of 46 to 50 feet, O. megalodon was an exceptionally large animal, likely the maximum size sharks can get.It is not entirely clear what adaptions enable sharks to grow bigger in size, but warm-bloodedness - the ability to maintain a relatively constant internal temperature - or oophagy - the practice of early-hatched embryos feeding on eggs still inside the mother's womb - has previously been proposed to have led to gigantismWarm-bloodedness is documented in the great white shark Carcharodon carcharias, often measuring more than 19 feet (or 6 meters) in length. Muscle movements keep its body temperature always over water temperatures. Cannibalistic egg-eating behavior of embryos still inside the mother, making it possible to give birth to larger-sized newborns, may prove advantageous in evolutionary terms and likely repeatedly evolved in shark lineages. Based on growth models, a newborn megalodon was already 9 feet (3 meters) long.",

    "content": "Born on the fourth of July, the fifth tropical depression of the Atlantic Ocean hurricane season strengthened into a tropical storm and was renamed.  At 11 p.m. EDT on July 5 (0300 UTC, July 6), Tropical Depression 5 strengthened into Tropical Storm Edouard.\n\nOn July 6 at 1:45 a.m. EDT (0545 UTC), the MODIS instrument aboard NASA’s Aqua satellite analyzed Tropical Storm Edouard’s cloud tops in infrared light. Infrared data provides temperature information, and the strongest thunderstorms that reach high into the atmosphere have the coldest cloud top temperatures.\n\nThe Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or MODIS instrument aboard NASA’s Aqua satellite found a small area of powerful thunderstorms northeast of the center of circulation, where temperatures were as cold as or colder than minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 56.6 Celsius). Cloud top temperatures that cold indicate strong storms with the potential to generate heavy rainfall. Southwesterly wind shear was pushing the strongest storms northeast of the tropical cyclone’s center. Satellite imagery indicates that the rest of Edouard was comprised of an exposed swirl of low- to mid-level clouds.\n\nIn general, wind shear is a measure of how the speed and direction of winds change with altitude. Tropical cyclones are like rotating cylinders of winds. Each level needs to be stacked on top each other vertically in order for the storm to maintain strength or intensify. Wind shear occurs when winds at different levels of the atmosphere push against the rotating cylinder of winds, weakening the rotation by pushing it apart at different levels. Winds from the west were displacing the bulk of clouds and showers from Edouard and pushing them to the east.\n\nAt 5 a.m. EDT (0900 UTC) on July 6, the center of Tropical Storm Edouard was located near latitude 39.0 degrees north and longitude 53.6 degrees west. It was centered about 530 miles (855 km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland, Canada. Maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 millibars.\n\nLittle significant change in strength is forecast before Edouard becomes post-tropical later in the day. Edouard was moving toward the northeast near 36 mph (57 kph) and this motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days, as it tracks toward the United Kingdom.\n\nNational Hurricane Center forecaster Jack Beven noted, “The cyclone is located in a region of strong southwesterly vertical wind shear, is heading for colder water, and is approaching a frontal system.  This combination should lead to extratropical transition between 12 to 24 hours, and it is possible that Edouard could strengthen a little as transition occurs.  After transition, the extratropical low should persist for another 24 hours or so before the circulation dissipates.”\n\nTyphoons/hurricanes are the most powerful weather events on Earth. NASA’s expertise in space and scientific exploration contributes to essential services provided to the American people by other federal agencies, such as hurricane weather forecasting.",

    "content": "A series of failures led to the crash of a Lion Air flight, which killed 189 people and led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, a report has found.\n\nInvestigators said faults by Boeing, Lion Air and pilots caused the crash.\n\nFive months after the disaster in October last year, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 people on board, which led to the grounding of the entire 737 Max fleet.\n\nFaults with the plane's design have been linked to both crashes.\n\nOn Friday, air crash investigators in Indonesia released their final report, detailing the list of events that caused the Lion Air jet to plunge into the Java Sea.\n\n\"From what we know, there are nine things that contributed to this accident,\" Indonesian air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo told reporters at a news conference.\n\n\"If one of the nine hadn't occurred, maybe the accident wouldn't have occurred.\"What does the report say?\nThe 353-page report found the jet should have been grounded before departing on the fatal flight because of an earlier cockpit issue.\n\nHowever, because the issue was not recorded properly the plane was allowed to take off without the fault being fixed, it said.\n\nFurther, a crucial sensor - which had been bought from a repair shop in Florida - had not been properly tested, the report found. On Friday, the US aviation regulator revoked the company's certification.\n\nThe sensor fed information to the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - or MCAS. That software, which is designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling, has been a focus for investigators trying to find the cause of both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.\n\nIndonesian investigators identified issues with the system, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control.\n\nIt showed there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the \"deficiencies\" had been highlighted during training.\n\nFurther, the report found that the first officer, who had performed poorly in training, struggled to run through a list of procedures that he should have had memorised.\n\nHe was flying the plane just before it entered into the fatal dive, but the report said the captain had not briefed him properly when he handed over the controls as they struggled to keep the plane in the air.\n\nThe report also found that 31 pages were missing from the plane's maintenance log.\n\nIndonesian investigators have previously said mechanical and design problems were key factors in the crash of the Lion Air plane.This report describes a catalogue of failures - from poor communication to bad design to inadequate flying skills - which culminated in the deaths of 189 people.\n\nThere are lots of what-ifs here. If the crew of the previous days flight had given a more detailed description of the problems they'd faced, the aircraft might never have taken off on its fatal flight. And if the captain, who'd successfully kept the plane in the air - despite the intervention of a rogue automated system he didn't understand - hadn't handed over to his less-capable first officer, disaster might still have been avoided.\n\nAs Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has repeatedly stated, there was a chain of events. But at the heart of that chain was MCAS - a control system that the pilots didn't know about, and which was vulnerable to a single sensor failure.\n\nBoeing - and regulators - allowed the system to be designed in this way and didn't change it after the Lion Air crash, leading to a further disaster. And that means that while the report clearly points to serious failures by a parts supplier and by the airline itself, it is Boeing that will bear the greatest share of responsibility.\n\nline\nHow has Boeing responded?\nIndonesian authorities laid out some recommendations for Boeing in the report, including that it redesign MCAS and provide adequate information about it in pilot manuals and training.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it was \"addressing\" the recommendations from Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee.\n\nThe planemaker said it was \"taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again\".\n\nOn Tuesday, the firm ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, making him the most senior official to leave the company since the two crashes.\n\nBoeing also said it expected the 737 Max to be re-certified for flying by the end of the year. The company said \"we look forward to continuing to work together\" with Lion Air in the future.\n\nA Lion Air spokesman said the crash was an \"unthinkable tragedy\" and it was essential to take immediate corrective actions to ensure a similar accident never occurred again.What has been the fallout for Boeing?\nThe pressure on Boeing to explain what it knew about the problems with the 737 Max has intensified. There were revelations this month that employees had exchanged messages about issues with MCAS while the plane was being certified in 2016.\n\nIn documents provided by Boeing to lawmakers, a pilot wrote that he had run into unexpected trouble during tests. He said he had \"basically lied to the regulators [unknowingly]\".\n\nBoeing said this week it had developed a training update and that it expected regulators to allow the planes to return to the skies before the beginning of 2020.\n\nThe grounding of the 737 Max has taken a toll on the planemaker.\n\nProfits more than halved to $895m (£687m) in the third quarter and the firm said it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliner, blaming trade uncertainties.\n\nBoeing boss Dennis Muilenburg was also stripped of his title as chairman by the board earlier this month, but remains as chief executive.",

    "content": "The spectre of coronavirus striking severely overcrowded refugee camps in Greece has hovered menacingly for months.\n\nInternational aid organisations, human rights groups and doctors have sounded the alarm. With the spread of the pandemic, calls for action to prevent impending medical catastrophe have become shriller. In Aegean islands on the frontline of the crisis, health carers speak of days gained, not won.\n\nBut an outbreak of the disease in two facilities near Athens has intensified concerns over the estimated 36,000 men, women and children stranded on remote isles opposite the Turkish coast.\n\nInstallations on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos – at six times over capacity, sprawling, wretched and congested – where social distancing, and other precautionary measures are an impossible privilege, offer fertile ground for Covid-19.\n\n“Time is on nobody’s side,” said Dutch physician Steven van de Vijver, the driving force behind an online petition urging EU leaders to bring refugees to safety by agreeing to take them in from Greece. Since its launch last week, more than 6,000 European doctors have signed the appeal.\n\n“It’s going to require superhuman force and a lot of luck now to stop this potentially lethal virus penetrating island camps,” he said. “At this point, I would say it’s almost impossible that it won’t happen.”After two weeks working in Moria, the squalid and notoriously overpopulated holding facility on Lesbos, De Vijver realised it was an illusion to think that, in such conditions, Covid-19 could be kept under control.\n\n“It would be a miracle and it’s dangerous to expect miracles to happen. Coronavirus doesn’t respect borders or barbed wire. People, camp workers, go in and out all the time, and with them the risk of the virus,” he said.Greek authorities recognise that they are in a race against the clock. Detection of the disease in camps in Malakasa and Ritsona – among 30 refugee facilities on the mainland – has put them in uncharted territory. Malakasa was placed in quarantine on Sunday, hours after an Afghan refugee began displaying symptoms of the virus; Ritsona, 75km north-east of the capital, was sealed off after 23 African asylum seekers tested positive on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian after ordering the first lockdown, Manos Logothetis, the migration ministry’s general secretary in charge of asylum seekers’ reception, said: “It’s the first case of coronavirus in a reception centre and, yes, we are testing our responses. We’ve quarantined the entire area and taken steps to isolate those with the virus. It’s not been easy, there’ve been protests.\n\n“Food has been brought by the International Organization for Migration, which is running the site, along with translators and cultural mediators. Testing will continue.”\n\nThe outbreak was traced to a 19-year-old Cameroonian woman found to be infected after giving birth in an Athens hospital.“All the rest who have tested positive are asymptomatic,” said Logothetis, a doctor himself. “I found that surprising, but as in all the camps Ritsona’s population is young. Most are under the age of 40 which is why we believe they’ll be able to ride this out.”\n\nHowever, many disagree. A surge in migrants from Turkey, even before the epidemic arrived in Europe, had increased concerns over the cramped and unsanitary conditions of reception centres in Greece.\n\nIncreasingly, NGOs have voiced fears over lack of access to testing, medical facilities and basic services, including water stations and taps. Calls for the evacuation of refugees to other EU countries have also soared amid evidence of the devastating effect coronavirus is likely to have on an already vulnerable population.\n\nHolding facilities on the mainland are generally managed better; refugees are accommodated in containers and pre-fab houses, in stark contrast to the tent cities on the Aegean isles that have long borne the brunt of the migrant and refugee crisis.\n\n“It is not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’ coronavirus strikes the camps,” said Sanne van der Kooij, a Dutch gynaecologist who has similarly volunteered in Moria multiple times. “I do not have a good feeling. I was last in Lesbos in February and worked at the local hospital where pregnant refugee women are moved to give birth. There were only six ICU beds and the care was very poor. The bed linens were filthy and the Greek doctors and nurses were clearly overwhelmed by the extra work.”\n\nAlthough so far confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported only among local people on Lesbos, refugees requiring emergency medical help run the risk of contracting the virus, she said. “In the hospital for example. That’s where so many will be at threat of coronavirus infection. And then the spread inside [the facility] will be very difficult to stop.”\n\nMost asylum seekers in the island camps are from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Unable to leave because of a containment policy determined by the EU, they have found themselves in limbo, trapped on the outposts opposite the Turkish coast until their asylum requests are processed.\n\nAlmost 35,000 European health workers and other citizens have also backed the doctors’ petition calling on EU governments to comply with an accord struck with Turkey in 2016 under which each member state agreed to take in a fixed number of refugees. Although it is central to a pact aimed at curbing migratory flows, the resettlement pledge was never fulfilled.\n\nGreece has, so far, had relative success in keeping transmission of the disease under control, announcing fewer than 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 76.\n\nBut health officials warn that the coming weeks are critical.\n\n“The EU will have blood on its hands if it continues to look away,” warned De Vijver, speaking from Amsterdam where most of his patients in the city’s main hospital are now suffering from coronavirus.\n\n“There are 22,000 people in Moria: men, women and children all packed into an area that is a fraction of the size of Hyde Park. Scabies, pneumonia, diarrhoea are rife,” he said, adding that conditions had deteriorated markedly since NGOs and volunteer medics had left the island following violent attacks by far-right vigilantes last month.\n\n“I was astounded to see that this terrible situation had caused 80% of the complaints we were dealing with. Politicians in the EU have a moral obligation to take these people in,” he said.\n\nGreece’s centre-right government has described the camps as “ticking health bombs”.\n\nSo far this year about 10,000 asylum seekers have been moved from the islands to the mainland – including 1,785 to closed, pre-deportation centres – according to the UN refugee agency. Plans are afoot to transfer another 600 people – 300 elderly refugees and their dependents – to hotels in Athens.\n\nReflecting restrictive measures enforced across Greece to combat Covid-19, authorities have allowed ATMs to be installed in the island facilities, as part of a wider lockdown on the camps.\n\nBut Logothetis accepts that in the event of a “mass coronavirus outbreak”, health officials on Lesbos would be hard pushed to cope. “In an ideal world we would rent a big venue, keep it warm and kit it out with beds. That I hope will be the next phase of our emergency operational plan because with so few ICUs on the island we don’t have the capacity to withstand the pressure if a lot of people were to get sick at the same time.”\n\nThe pandemic has effectively stopped any prospect of voluntary returns of migrants under a EU-funded scheme announced last month. Citing coronavirus concerns, the asylum service is also sputtering. Though operational again following Athens’ suspension of applications in response to Turkey’s abrupt decision to relax border controls and allow refugees to head to Europe, the service is not receiving new requests.Hopes of resettling around 1,600 unaccompanied children to other parts of Europe have also dwindled. Officials say member states now want additional health checks, “which will take time”.\n\nWith the spectre of gridlock, Athens has come under increased pressure from the EU to relocate asylum seekers to the mainland. But that, says Greece’s migration minister Notis Mitarachi, is practically impossible without adequate accommodation.\n\nAddressing the EU parliament’s home affairs committee as police moved to lock down Ritsona, he reiterated what prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said repeatedly: Europe should do more to help because Greece “cannot resolve this crisis instantly and alone”.\n\nIt is a refrain echoed by Logothetis. “We need support and we need to share the burden,” he said. “If each of the other 26 EU member states agreed to take in 2,000 people, our problem would be more than settled. I’d be able to empty the islands in a day.”",

    "content": "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said it was “absolutely possible” his forces helped people cross into the European Union, but denied inviting them to the country.\n\nEuropean governments have accused Belarus of artificially creating the crisis by bringing in people from abroad and taking them to the border with promises of an easy crossing into the bloc. Belarus has denied the claim, instead criticising the EU for shutting its borders.Asked if Belarus was helping refugees and migrants try and cross into Poland, Lukashenko said: “I think that’s absolutely possible.\n\n“We’re Slavs. We have hearts. Our troops know the migrants are going to Germany … Maybe someone helped them,” he told the BBC. “But I didn’t invite them here,” he said.\n\nPolish border guards on Friday said there were attempted crossings from Belarus by two groups of migrants and refugees on what is the eastern border of the European Union and NATO – one involving 500 people, some of whom threw rocks and tear gas canisters, aided by Belarusian authorities. The guards said they had arrested 45 people.\n\nAl Jazeera, like all other media, is unable to independently verify claims about activity on the border as Poland has banned reporters from accessing the 3km (2 miles)-wide zone.\n\nThe accusation by Poland suggests the crisis has not been resolved by an apparent change of tack by Minsk, which on Thursday had cleared the main camps by the border and allowed the first repatriation flight to Iraq in months.\n\nAid groups say at least 11 asylum seekers and refugees have died on both sides of the border since the crisis began earlier this year – although the real number is believed to be higher – as concerns grow for people’s wellbeing amid freezing winter conditions.\n\nHuman rights groups say Poland has exacerbated the suffering by sending back those who try to cross. Poland says this is necessary to stop more people from coming.Poland and its allies accuse Belarus of deliberately enticing thousands of migrants and refugees, many of whom are from the Middle East, and funnelling them to the country’s frontier with Poland in response to Western sanctions against Lukashenko’s government following his controversial re-election last year.Minsk, backed by Russia, denies that and has accused Polish security forces of carrying out crimes against humanity while repelling people trying to enter the EU.\n\nLukashenko and his main ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, spoke by phone on Friday and stressed “the importance of the establishment of cooperation between Minsk and the EU to resolve the problem”.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine, which borders both Belarus and Poland, said it was preparing “systematically and thoroughly” in case the crisis shifted to its territory.\n\n“We do not exclude the possibility that Russia will decide to purposefully send a large number of illegal migrants through Belarus to our territory,” Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky told parliament.\n\nHe said the situation on Ukraine’s border was currently under control, but warned that migrants who decide to cross over will be pushed back with any means necessary, including firearms.\n\nOn Friday, Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak tweeted that Warsaw was “happy to accept Estonia’s proposal” to send 100 troops to the border.\nThe migrants from the camps on the Belarusian side were taken on Thursday to a huge, crowded warehouse and journalists were permitted to film them. Children ran about on Friday morning, and men played cards while one dangled a toddler on his lap.\n\n“This is not a life but this is not permanent, this should be just temporary until they decide our destiny: to take us to Europe or bring us back to our countries,” 23-year-old electrician Mohammed Noor told Reuters news agency.\n\n“What I wish for myself, I wish it for others too – to go to Europe and live a stable life.”\n\nMeanwhile in a hospital in Bielsk Podlaski, on the Polish side, two migrants who had been caught after crossing were given treatment before being taken away by Polish border guards.\n\nBefore he was taken away, Mansour Nassar, 42, a father of six from Aleppo, in Syria, who had travelled to Belarus from Lebanon, described his ordeal during five days in the forest.\n\n“The Belarusian army told us: ‘If you come back, we will kill you’,” he said, in tears in his hospital bed. “We drank from ponds… Our people are always oppressed.”\n\nKassam Shahadah, a Syrian refugee doctor living in Poland who helps out in another hospital, said patients were terrified of being forcibly returned to Belarus.\n\n“What they have seen, what they have lived through on that side is a nightmare for them,” he said.The Council of Europe human rights commissioner Dunja Mijatovic called the humanitarian situation along the border “alarming” and demanded an end to Poland’s controversial returns of migrants to Belarus.\n\n“I have personally listened to the appalling accounts of extreme suffering from desperate people … who spent weeks or even months in squalid and extreme conditions in the cold and wet woods due to these pushbacks,” she said in a statement.\n\n“All pushbacks must end immediately.”\n\nShe also called on Poland to allow rights activists and media “immediate and unimpeded access to all areas along the border”.\n\nBelarus said Thursday there were about 7,000 migrants in the ex-Soviet country.\n\nVladimir Sotnikov, a political scientist from the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Al Jazeera that a potential solution to this situation is for the EU to compromise.\n\n“Probably, [a] solution could be.. [for the] EU [to] accept President Lukashenko as a legitimate president, and then Lukashenko could start negotiations with the EU just to defuse the crisis and to have a compromise,” he said.",

    "content": "The social uprising in Chile has now reached its fourth month. Masses of people continue to protest and demand structural change despite ferocious repression—mainly at the hands of the militarized Carabineros police force—which has revived traumatic memories. Now, Chileans are looking ahead to a plebiscite that may open the way to a new Constitution. The dictatorship-era charter has been a major obstacle to change over the past three decades. Redrafting the constitution is a key demand in Chileans’ sweeping rebuke of the status quo.  \n\nGeneral Augusto Pinochet’s 1980 Constitution both symbolizes and imposes the authoritarian model at the root of the ongoing mobilization. The Constitution institutionalized the economic and political domination of the dictatorship and enshrined a neoliberal framework that erased the role of the state in social and economic areas. It restricted political participation, gave the Right disproportionate power, and installed a tutelary role for the armed forces. And it continues to straightjacket the Chilean system. I, among others, analyzed such regimes in the 1990s—I termed them “guardian systems.”\n\nDespite 30 years of post-dictatorship elected rule and some reforms to the 1980 Constitution, the market model embodied in Pinochet’s charter still shapes economics and politics in the country. Pinochet’s radical neoliberal transformation privatized the pension system and promoted the development of a private sector in the health and education fields. These privatizations have perpetuated inequality and reinforced extreme social divisions. Moreover, Chile is the only country in the world with almost completely privatized water—Chapter III, Clause 24 of the 1980 Constitution establishes the “right” to private ownership of water. Drought paired with the corporate monopolization of water resources concessioned to the mining and agriculture industries have caused multiple communities, small farms, and cities in various parts of the country to run dry in the past year. The Constitution locked in these “guardian structures” by imposing strict rules for constitutional amendments, requiring supermajorities in Congress.\n\nChile’s elected governments have not reformed or democratized the Carabineros since the dictatorship, and the militarized police continue to treat the Chilean people as “the internal enemy.” Shortly after the protests began in October, president Sebastián Piñera, a right-wing billionaire, declared while surrounded by military officers: “We are at war.” He called thousands of army troops to patrol the streets for the first time since the dictatorship, to enforce a 10-day curfew, evoking memories of Pinochet’s terror. Piñera’s government, whose support has vacillated between 4 to 7 percent in 2020, has used repression to sow fear, intimidate, and attempt to divide protesters. But outrage over the October crackdown only spurred more massive demonstrations. On October 25, 1.2 million chilenos gathered to protest in Santiago’s Plaza Italia. “¡Chile despertó!” they chanted. “Chile woke up.”\n\nSince then, several international human rights delegations have criticized the security forces, denouncing the deliberate intent to inflict harm on the protesters rather than disperse them. In November 2019, Human Rights Watch noted “compelling evidence of excessive use of force and abuses against demonstrators and bystanders.” Chileans are struggling against the repression of the state as well as the unjust economic system. They are demanding rights for the people as opposed to private profit-making.\n\nInequality in Chile\n\nThe October protests put Chile’s entrenched inequality in the spotlight. A 2019 study by The Lancet showed that a woman in a poor district of Santiago lives some 18 years less than a woman in a rich neighborhood in the same city. Chile’s income inequality gap is more than 65 percent wider than the OECD average, and it has one of the highest ratios between the average income of the wealthiest and poorest 10 percent of the population, according to a 2018 report. The neoliberal gutting of public services has fueled rampant inequality. The country has two health systems: an excellent private system for those who can pay First World fees, and a severely underfunded public system serving some 80 percent of Chileans. Wait times in public hospitals can last for years and there are insufficient supplies. Almost 10,000 persons died in the first half of 2018 while waiting for an operation or treatment in the public system.\n\nThe privatized pension system, which has produced a bonanza of wealth for its investors, pays a pittance to elderly people who worked their whole lives. According to a 2015 report by La Comisión Asesora Presidencial sobre el Sistema de Pensiones, 80 percent of retirees receive less than the minimum wage of $414 per month in pensions. The educational system reproduces class divisions, as youths from the upper classes easily enter prestigious universities, while those from modest backgrounds come from substandard schools. University education—considered a market commodity and not a right or a public good—is expensive, and families go into debt for years to pay. Salaries are low and the cost of living continues to increase. The metro fare hike that sparked the social uprising in October was the last straw. As the protesters chanted, “It’s not 30 pesos, it’s 30 years!”\n\nChile’s Social Rebellion\n\nWhile continuing Chile’s rich history of popular resistance, the demonstrations since October also mark a new era of social struggle defined by broad-based participation, youth involvement, and new forms and symbols of autonomous mobilization. “María,” (not her real name), who has attended all the Friday protests as well as others, explained that since October, the Carabineros, with their tanks and squadrons, have blocked the avenues where people have traditionally marched. María, a young professional and social science graduate, pointed out that that the strategy produces large concentrations of people in the plazas. The primera linea—youths who wear bandanas and carry homemade shields—ring the crowd to protect them from bullets, gas canisters, and advances by the Carabineros. Meanwhile, popular symbols have changed. In large demonstrations in the past, people carried the banners of their political parties or social organizations. Such banners are gone in the protests today, reflecting the spontaneous nature of the social explosion and its distance from the political parties. Today people carry Chilean flags, Mapuche flags, or black flags condemning state violence. More surprising are the banners denoting allegiance to particular fútbol teams, such as Colo-Colo, which is something new. The protests grow in size whenever there is a new outrage.Chileans are demanding an end to socioeconomic and political exclusion. Some 70 to 80 percent are in favor of a new Constitution—forged under democracy—to guarantee social rights. Chileans now look forward to the national plebiscite called for April 26 to vote for a path toward a Constitution that will protect the rights to education, health, and decent pensions, among others. The Piñera government initially resisted the idea of a plebiscite, but reluctantly acquiesced after political parties in Congress signed an agreement in November 2019 to move toward a solution to the massive unrest.\n\nThe plebiscite will ask voters two questions: whether or not they want a new Constitution, and whether they want the constitutional convention that would draft it to be made up of citizens or a mixed body of citizens and legislators. The convention would draft a new Constitution to be ratified in another national plebiscite.\n\nThe constituent process had to be approved by Congress and parliamentarians have a key role in legislating the mechanisms needed for the constitutional process. The Left has pushed for the constituent convention to have gender parity and to reserve seats for independent social activists, not only political party members, as well as Mapuche representatives, but these measures have not yet succeeded in Congress. In the Senate, 3/5 approval was necessary to approve gender parity; although outvoted, the right-wing minority had enough votes in January to block the measure. The extreme Right is already lobbying against the new Constitution. In particular, members of the Unión Demócrata Independiente (UDI), founded by Pinochet functionaries, prefer authoritarian options to preserve their wealth and power. Some sectors of the extreme Right want to annul the plebiscite entirely, arguing that there is too much violence for the process to take place.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has made its position clear. On December 16, when a television journalist asked whether he would contemplate a new model as people were demanding, Piñera— a key proponent of Trump’s campaign to oust Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro—retorted: “If you speak of a change in the model you’re thinking of Venezuela!” On February 2, the minister of education, Marcela Cubillos, declared that she was not “neutral” on the constitutional process, stating that “the government represents a project of society whose fundamental values are expressed in the current Constitution.” Cubillos, a UDI member, is known for her repressive reactions to protests, her intransigence, and her hostile attitude toward educational reform. Her father was a navy officer, an organizer of the 1973 coup, and Pinochet’s minister of foreign relations for two years.\n\nCarabinero Repression\n\nThe casualties suffered by the social movement have been the worst since the dictatorship. The Carabineros use aggressive and unprovoked violence against demonstrators and onlookers, deploying tanks to spew toxic gases in large crowds and shooting tear gas canisters and rifles directly at protesters. Piñera has praised the force, while its commander, General Rozas, has stayed in the shadows. Indeed, the government has refused to remove him, despite repeated requests by political party leaders and social activists. Five human rights reports—authored by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), among others—have denounced the brutal and indiscriminate violence of the militarized police. Some 36 people have died, though exact tolls vary. The OHCHR reported that 28,000 people were jailed between October 18 and December 6, many arbitrarily. In a January 31 report, the Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos (INDH) noted that 427 persons had suffered mutilations of their eyes due to state violence. Some people have completely lost one or both eyes.Rights groups have documented how the Carabineros have aimed teargas canisters and rifles at people’s heads, against their own protocols. Police rifles were supposedly equipped with rubber bullets, but the University of Chile discovered police were firing shotgun pellets, with only a small proportion of rubber. The OHCHR, in its December 2019 report, decried “torture, ill-treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence” against those detained by the Carabineros and denounced the “unnecessary and disproportionate use of less-lethal weapons, in particular anti-riot shotguns, during peaceful demonstrations and/or outside the context of violent confrontations between demonstrators and security forces.” Videos circulated on social media show the Carabineros have used their vehicles to hit and crush people. They also have attacked medics, press people, and human rights observers with clearly marked signs and uniforms.On January 28, as fans were leaving a stadium in Santiago after a soccer game, a Carabinero truck traveling at high velocity hit a fan named Jorge Mora and kept driving. The incident was caught on video and went viral on social media, provoking enormous protests. Mora died before reaching the hospital. The same night, Piñera, said in an event, “When the Carabineros go out on the street they do so to protect public order.” The Carabinero driving the truck was detained, but the next day a court freed him and told him to sign in once a week at the police station. This ruling provoked even more outrage.\n\nHundreds of beatings of civilians, especially by groups of Carabineros, have been concentrated in Santiago Centro and in Puente Alto, singling out this working-class barrio in the southern part of the city. The INDH documented a total of 697 cases of squads of state agents attacking and beating lone civilians between the start of the uprising and January 31, including 123 incidents involving Carabineros, nine involving military men, and seven involving the investigative police. One notorious incident took place on January 29, when, after a protest over Jorge Mora’s death, seven or eight Carabineros attacked and savagely beat an18-year-old named Matías Soto. They left the youth on the sidewalk, with multiple fractures, jumped back into their van, and drove off. A security camera captured the entire assault. The INDH filed a lawsuit for torture in this case.\n\nIn addition to the police brutality, beloved symbols of popular culture have also suffered damage. The tomb of New Song folksinger Víctor Jara, who was tortured and murdered in 1973, was vandalized on January 18. The Víctor Jara Foundation organized a ceremony to clean and beautify the tomb, gathering musicians and the general public in the cemetery to dispel the aura of hatred. The Centro Arte Alameda, an arts center dating from 1992 near Plaza Italia, was burned and heavily damaged due to a fire in December. The center had provided space to medical personnel and people wounded in the demonstrations. While the fire is still under investigation, witnesses said Carabinero canisters started the blaze and videos seemed to verify that. On February 7, the Violeta Parra Museum, dedicated to the national artist and singer-songwriter, was burned after the Carabineros fired at least six flaming tear gas canisters at the building. Videos posted on Twitter as well as eyewitnesses documented this case.\n\nThe Protests Continue \n\nDespite the repression, Chileans continue to demonstrate almost every day, and large protests continue each Friday in Plaza Italia, popularly renamed Plaza de la Dignidad. The Carabineros mobilize in force on Fridays, and incidents invariably occur. The composition of the crowds has changed since the early days, when hundreds of thousands of people of all ages went to the plaza. Today, most of the demonstrators are young. They don gasmasks and bandanas, and some have begun fighting back when cornered by Carabineros. Some Carabineros have been injured, although statistics vary widely.\n\nThe Chilean people are determined, they are creative, and they are resilient. Protesters have worked with firefighters to put out fires started by tear gas canisters. Thousands of fans at soccer games have held up huge banners, denouncing the repression and chanting against Piñera. Bike riders have staged mass group rides to protest. People chant against the government in traditional festivals and carnivals. Popular musicians have played in large concerts and benefits to help victims of the violence, especially those who have lost eyes. Hundreds of women have performed the spoken feminist anthem “El violador eres tú” by Las Tésis, which has also been replicated around the world in different languages. Singers such as Nano Stern and Ana Tijoux have written songs about the rebellion and the state’s violence, while people continue to sing other songs, including the iconic, politically conscious music of Víctor Jara and Los Prisioneros. National poet Raúl Zurita wrote an anguished poem called “Venceremos” about the hundreds of eye injuries, which captures the solidarity of the Chileans with the words:\n\nAnd we will embrace each other weeping\n\nAnd we will embrace each other singing\n\nAnd my eyes will be your eyes\n\nAnd all Chile will be your eyes…\n\nPopular street murals, along with graffiti, cover the walls of central Santiago, and makeshift memorials and flowers mark the places where people died. Protesters carry a giant plaster statue of the “revolutionary dog” El Negro Matapacos—a street dog who accompanied students during the 2011 protests, and other later ones—along with other puppets, and some demonstrators dress as aliens or cartoon characters such as Pikachu.Piñera has made small concessions but has resisted any structural change to the neoliberal model. His response to social demands has been repression rather than dialogue. Piñera and his allies have pushed to enact a “security agenda” which has had some success in Congress. In January, Congress passed an “anti-looting law” that criminalized various protest tactics such as building barricades, blocking traffic, and wearing bandanas. The law is now in effect. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights had expressed alarm in a letter to Congress, stating: “Some of the legislative initiatives risk harming the exercise of a series of human rights, particularly…freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of expression…”\n\nThe Plebiscite and the Future of Chile\n\nWill the people of Chile be able to shape their own destiny via a plebiscite? Two months before the scheduled vote, the answer remains uncertain. Approval ratings of Chile’s institutions, including the Congress and the president’s office, rank at an all-time low in surveys. María, the protester, expressed her greatest hope for this process: “We want an end to this neoliberal system with its injustices and its inequalities, so people can live with more fairness and more dignity,” she said. “We want to end the Constitution of Pinochet and to move toward a state with social justice.” Her greatest fear? “That nothing will change.”\n\nThe month of March will be definitive in this struggle. Schools begin again and Chileans return to daily life. Chileans are very clear that they want a new political and socioeconomic model that assures their rights. Their struggle to transform the state has implications for all of Latin America, and indeed, for the world. Chile represents the hope that “people power” can overcome extreme versions of neoliberalism and restricted forms of politics to achieve new, more democratic systems of governance.",

    "content": "So much so, that this tiny nation, all by itself, brought to a screeching halt Latin America’s disastrous shift to the right that, after progressive governments stumbled in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, “experts” had already certified as inevitable and unstoppable.\n\nYet, Moreno, a 64-year-old paraplegic who, from 2007 to 2013, was president Rafael Correa’s second in command, defeated former banker Guillermo Lasso, the Ecuadoran oligarchy’s great hope for recapturing power after 10 years of progressive policies under the popular and charismatic Correa.\n\n“I will be the president of everyone, but especially the poor,” Moreno, who has been wheelchair-bound since he was shot by robbers in 1998, said after his victory.Without a doubt, Correa, who was 43 when he became president for the first time in 2007, will be a tough act to follow. An economist trained in the U.S. and Belgium, he was able to bring stability to his country for the first time in years, invested oil wealth in important infrastructure works and social programs that lifted hundreds of thousands of his compatriots out of poverty.Yet, Ecuador’s economy suffered due to a downturn in oil prices, and the 2016 massive earthquake that killed hundreds of people, injured thousands more and left in its wake terrible destruction. The opposition tried to use the country’s tragedy for electoral gain, blaming Correa and his Alianza País party for the increase in poverty.\n\nBut Lasso, who proposed to cut social spending and reduce taxes for the rich and for businesses, could not bamboozle the majority of Ecuadorans who had not forgotten he was part of president Jamil Mahuad’s government.\n\nMahuad presided over a banking crisis known as the “bank holiday” that plunged the country into unspeakable misery and forced 1.5 million people to leave for Europe and the U.S. seeking a way to survive. The financial collapse destroyed the sucre, the national currency, and left Ecuador deep in debt, which Correa would later declare immoral and refuse to pay. \n\nIn this election, Ecuadorans were not willing to entrust the future of their country to someone like Lasso, one of the very same people who had impoverished them while making themselves even richer at their expense.Not surprisingly, Lasso is disputing the results after having declared himself the winner, even though international observers have made clear the election was legitimate and there was no sign of fraud. The OAS and an increasing number of governments like Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Venezuela have recognized the legitimate triumph of Moreno and Alianza País and their Citizenship Revolution. Washington hasn’t pronounced itself yet.\n\n“I leave the country in good hands,” Correa said standing next to the president-elect.\n\"A big hug to those who believed in our proposal as well as to those who did not vote for us; we'll work for them too,\" Moreno tweeted on Monday.\n\nLike it or not, 21st century socialism and its promise of justice and fairness for the people of Latin America is very much alive.\n\nAs I told you before, Ecuadorans are not fools.",

    "content": "Climate Impacts That Might Affect Algal Blooms:\nWarming water temperature  Toxic blue-green algae thrive in warm, slow-moving water.\nHarmful algae usually bloom during the warm summer season or when water temperatures are warmer than usual. Warmer water due to climate change might favor harmful algae in a number of ways:\n\nToxic blue-green algae prefer warmer water.\nWarmer temperatures prevent water from mixing, allowing algae to grow thicker and faster.\nWarmer water is easier for small organisms to move through and allows algae to float to the surface faster.\nAlgal blooms absorb sunlight, making water even warmer and promoting more blooms.\nChanges in salinity\nClimate change might lead to more droughts, which make freshwater saltier. This can cause marine algae to invade freshwater ecosystems. In the southwestern and south central United States, toxic marine algae have been killing fish in freshwater lakes since 2000.\n\nHigher carbon dioxide levels\nAlgae need carbon dioxide to survive. Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air and water can lead to rapid growth of algae, especially toxic blue-green algae that can float to the surface of the water.\n\nChanges in rainfall   Extreme storms followed by periods of drought can lead to more algal blooms like this one seen in Iowa in 2011.\nClimate change might affect rainfall patterns, leading to alternating periods of drought and intense storms. This can cause more nutrient runoff into waterbodies, feeding more algal blooms.\n\nSea level rise\nScientists predict that sea level could rise up to one meter by the year 2100. This would create more shallow and stable coastal water, conditions that are perfect for the growth of algae.\n\nCoastal upwelling\nCoastal upwelling is the process by which winds push surface water offshore and deep water moves towards the coast, bringing nutrients from the ocean floor to the surface. Climate change is expected to alter the timing and intensity of coastal upwelling. Along the west coast of the United States, excess nutrients delivered by upwelling might lead to more algal blooms.",

    "content": "The strength of pharmaceutical research and development, and unprecedented global collaborations are leading to the fastest rollout of vaccines in history.\n\nThrough the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, the global effort to securing a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in a manner that is effective and fair, has been set in motion. We, in the research-based pharmaceutical industry, fully support COVAX and its objectives. Beyond developing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, we are scaling up manufacturing to ensure equitable access to people around the world.The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), the body representing the innovative biopharmaceutical industry, outlined the key milestones leading to the commitment to rollout two billion doses of vaccines to lower-middle-income countries through COVAX.\n\nLet’s remember the events of 2020: On Jan. 10, SARS-CoV-2 sequence data was shared through the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) Initiative. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Just eight days later, the research-based global pharmaceutical industry made a commitment to address COVID-19.\n\nWe leveraged our expertise and know-how to speed up the development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 in collaboration with others. Vaccine makers used their wide scientific insights from decades of working in developing medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics for infectious diseases such as MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), Ebola, and influenza while closely working with regulators. In April, the first human clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine was conducted. On April 24, the IFPMA joined the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which led COVAX.\n\nCOVAX is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), WHO, and the GAVI Vaccines Alliance alongside key delivery partner UNICEF. The COVAX facility aims to provide doses for at least 20% of countries’ populations.\n\nOn Sept. 8, nine vaccine makers made a pledge, outlining a united commitment to rigorous scientific and regulatory processes, complying with strict requirements to develop safe and effective vaccines.  On Dec. 31, the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine received WHO Emergency Use Listing.\n\nThis brings us to 2021, with the listing of AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine on Feb. 15.\n\nDuring the first quarter of the year, COVAX with UNICEF will begin with the full-year rollout of two billion doses to protect high-risk and vulnerable people and frontline healthcare workers as priorities.\n\nAs of Feb. 16, the WHO reported 69 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation and 181 candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation.  In late January, Johnson & Johnson announced that its single-shot vaccine met primary endpoints in an interim analysis of its Phase 3 trial.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are designed to help our bodies develop immunity to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 without us getting the infection. Different types of COVID-19 vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, inoculation with a COVID-19 vaccine provides the body with a supply of “memory cells” that will remember how to fight the novel coronavirus in the future, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explained. GAVI and an article in the Healthcare IT News gave an overview of the four main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are already developed or are still in development. These four main types are:\n\nWhole virus vaccines use a weakened or deactivated form of the novel coronavirus to trigger protective immunity to it. Live attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the virus that can still replicate without causing illness. Inactivated vaccines use viruses whose genetic material has been destroyed so they cannot replicate, but can still trigger an immune response. Both types use well-established technology and pathways for regulatory approval.\n\nNucleic acid vaccines use genetic material — either RNA or DNA — to provide cells with the instructions to make the viral spike protein of the novel coronavirus. Once this genetic material gets into human cells, it uses our cells’ protein factories to make the antigen that will trigger an immune response. Since the antigen is produced inside our own cells and in large quantities, the immune reaction should be strong.Viral vector vaccines, like nucleic acid vaccines, work by giving cells genetic instructions to produce antigens. However, a key difference is that this type of vaccine uses a harmless virus, different from the one the vaccine is targeting, to deliver these instructions into the cell. One type of virus that has often been used as a vector is adenovirus, which causes the common cold. As with nucleic acid vaccines, our own cellular machinery is hijacked to produce the antigen from those instructions, in order to trigger an immune response.\n\nProtein subunit vaccines use pieces of the pathogen — often fragments of protein — to trigger an immune response. Doing so minimizes the risk of side effects, but it also means the immune response may be weaker. This is why protein subunit vaccines often require adjuvants to help boost the immune response.\n\nAdults with existing health conditions and those with compromised immune systems must consult their doctors when deciding which type of vaccine will be most appropriate for them.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry’s commitment to develop, manufacture, and make vaccines available stem from the belief that no one is really safe unless everyone is safe from COVID-19.Teodoro B. Padilla is the executive director of the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP). PHAP and its member companies represent the research-based pharmaceutical sector in the country.",

    "content": "The coca and poppy cultivation in the Andean jungle is\nsignificantly damaging the environment in the region.  The main\nthreats to the environment are deforestation caused by clearing\nthe fields for cultivation, soil erosion caused by several\nfactors, and chemical pollution from insecticides and\nfertilizers.  Additionally, the process of converting coca and\npoppy into cocaine and heroine has adverse effects on the\nenvironment as well.  These environmental issues are difficult to\naddress due to cocaşs position as a traditional crop and trade\nitem, the influence and wealth of the drug traffickers opposing\nrestrictions, and the issue of national sovereignty.  Most\nrealize the social impact of the drug trade worldwide, but few\nrealize the environmental impact.  Hopefully, this case study\nwill help bring the situation to light.\n\n2.        Description\n\n     Coca has been an important cultivated crop in the Andean\nregion for over 4,000 years and has been an integral component in\nthe trade between the highland areas and the coast for nearly as\nlong (see COCA case).  The cultural homogeneity of the regions\nwas first established and maintained through these trade\nrelationships which are still largely in effect today.\nArchaeologists have discovered numerous artifacts indicating that\nthe chewing of the coca leaf has been used by the inhabitants of\nthe region from as far south as Chile to northern Central America\nsince 2100 BC.  Traditionally, the coca leaf has been chewed to\nrelieve fatigue and hunger, as it is a mild stimulant.\nAdditionally, it has the medical applications of helping relieve\naltitude sickness and conserve body heat.  It also provides some\nessential vitamins when consumed.  Obviously, these three\ncharacteristics are particularly useful in the mountainous Andes.\nIn the historical past the coca leaf has been integral to a\nnumber of religious ceremonies, based on prehistoric use\npatterns.  The use of coca has always figured prominently in\nAndean cultural and religious daily life and continues to do so\neven today.\n\n     The coca leaf contains less than 1% cocaine and has much the\nsame effect as caffeine.  Therefore, even though cocaine is\nprocessed from coca leaves, the two products are dramatically\ndifferent in effects and usage.  One of the challenges in\nlimiting coca growth is to satisfy this benign traditional demand\nwhile eliminating the cash crop business that supplies the\ncocaine producers.\n\n     The evolution of coca into the cash crop of the Andes has\nbeen occurring for the last century.  From the commercial (Coca\nCola is widely known for past usage of the drug in their product)\nand medicinal (along with opium, cocaine was used to alleviate\npain in the injured during the Civil War and afterward) sales of\nthe early twentieth century to the multi-billion dollar drug\nbusiness that exists today, coca had and has a significant\ninfluence upon economic life in the Andes.  Strategies to arrest\nthe drug problem can be separated into two distinct approaches:\nreduction of demand and reduction of supply.\n\n     When considering the problems of the drug use, most of the\nattention of scholars and professionals focuses on the social and\neconomic aspects of the situation.  Until recently very little\nwork has isolated the environmental consequences of the\nincreasing coca cultivation, which are considerable.  The Andean\nregion is among the most ecologically diverse and sensitive areas\nof the Earth and it has been subjected to increasingly stressful\nabuse in recent years as a result of drug crop cultivation.\nThere are three primary environmental consequences of coca and\npoppy cultivation: deforestation and the destruction of the\nhabitat, soil erosion, and pollution of both air and water.\nAdditionally, the processing of the raw drug crops into their\nrefined forms also has a destructive environmental consequence.\n\n     Easily the most visible environmentally destructive effect\nof coca and poppy cultivation is deforestation.  During a fifteen\nyear period beginning in the 1970şs, 700,000 hectares of rain\nforest in the Amazon basin was destroyed to clear land for coca\ngrowth.  The immediate effect of deforestation is the reduction\nof natural habitat and subsequent reduction in the bio-diversity\nof the region.  A secondary effect of the deforestation derives\nfrom the typical method of preparing an area for cultivation\nthrough a slash and burn procedure.  This burning is the major\nsource of air pollution in the jungle.  Though these consequences\nare significant, the most critical effect of deforestation is\nthat it leads to soil erosion.\n\n     Due to the illegality of coca and poppy growth the farmers\nplace their fields on hillsides, which are more difficult for the\ngovernment agents to reach than fields located on the valley\nfloors.  Because the government does pursue an active eradication\ncampaign, the farmers rarely expect to enjoy long-term\ncultivation of their fields and, consequently, rarely employ soil\nconservation techniques.  The coca fields are planted along the\ncontours of the land with little terracing and the fields are\nkept bare of plants except for the coca or poppy plants.  These\nmethods, in combination with the steep slopes, serve to strip\naway topsoil with every strong wind and heavy rain, very quickly\nmaking the fields infertile not only for further cultivation but\nfor jungle plant life as well.  Recent observers over-flying the\njungle describe it as a patchwork quilt of green broken by\npatches of gray desolation.  In addition to causing soil\ninfertility, the topsoil runoff fills waterways and rivers with\nsediment changing their courses, causing flooding, and killing\nfish and aquatic plant life by lowering the oxygen content of the\nwater and smothering the river bottoms.  Locals who used to\ndepend on the large fish in the rivers for food, no longer find\nany fish large enough to eat.\n\n     Pollution is also a factor in the environmental\ndestructiveness of coca and poppy cultivation.  The pesticides\nused by the growers travel through the soil into the ground water\nand eventually into the rivers and streams.  Pesticides are\ninherently toxic to the insects but they can also harm larger\nanimals and people in greater concentrations.  Fish and other\naquatic life are particularly susceptible to this contamination.\nAnother source of pollution is the fertilizer used by the\ngrowers, which also enters the water systems after chemically\n\"burning\" the more sensitive vegetation of the region.  The\nfertilizer in the water encourages the algae  to grow at\nincreased rates while killing the organisms that feed on it.  As\na result, the algae overwhelms other aquatic plant life and\nrestricts water flow.\n\n     The processing of coca leaves into coca paste and cocaine\nhas its own environmentally damaging effects.  U.S. State\nDepartment studies indicate that ş10 million liters of sulfuric\nacid, 16 million liters of ethyl ether, 8 million liters of\nacetone, and from 40-770 million liters of keroseneş are poured\ndirectly into the ground by cocaine processors working in the\nAndean region, mainly Colombia, yearly.  The consequences of this\npollution are quickly felt in the small rivers where the aquatic\nlife is devastated.  The primary growing area in southern\nColombia, the Caqueta river basin, is particularly polluted.\nThere have also been increasing reports of sickness among the\npeople and livestock of these areas, who rely on the rivers and\nwell for water.\n\n     In addition to its standing as the world's premier cocaine\nproducer, Colombia now ranks as the worldşs third largest\nproducer of opium, the largest in the western hemisphere.  North\nAmerica has been receiving an increasing amount of heroin in\nrecent years as the Cali cartel has taken advantage of the land\nless suitable for coca growth and planted it with poppies.  This\nincrease in heroin growth in Colombia appears to be unrelated to\nthe Opium Wars in Southeast Asia as the increase in U.S.\nconsumption came about only after increased exports from Colombia\nhad been established.  Thus, the Colombians seem to have\nincreased demand for their heroin in the U.S. through increased\nsupply at lower prices and not through supplanting the previous\nsupply from Southeast Asia.  Estimations place total area under\npoppy cultivation at 20,000 hectares, which has ideal growing\nconditions slightly hotter and dryer than coca requires.  Though\nthe effects of poppy growth in Colombia are largely unpublished,\nthe same farmers are growing both crops and it can be assumed\nthat similar damage is being committed in poppy cultivation as is\nbeing done in coca cultivation.\n\n     During the last several years drug traffickers have\nincreased their ownership of agriculturally suitable land four-\nfold; they now control through direct or intermediary ownership\n8%-11% of all agricultural land in Colombia.  This is extremely\nalarming as this control gives the drug traffickers more direct\nopportunity to utilize the land for drug crop cultivation, which,\nas stated above, is extremely destructive to the jungle\nenvironment.\n\n     In 1992, Colombia only produced 13 percent of the world's\ncoca, but its cartels now have a strangle-hold on the world's\ncocaine processing, at 70-80 percent of total production and\ndistribution world wide.  This concentration of business has had\nan enormous effect in Colombia.  First, estimates place the total\nof drug money repatriated into the Colombian economy to be as\nhigh as $7 billion, this is almost as large as the total\nlegitimate exports for Colombia which were $7.6 billion in 1993.\nThese huge profits exert an enormous influence over every aspect\nof life in Colombia.  The trafficking organizations employ\nthousands of people from the farmer in the field to irregular\ntroops and assassins to pilots, chemists, lawyers, and other\nprofessionals.  These vast amounts of money give the traffickers\nsignificant means to protect themselves from the law both local\nand national.  Over $100 million is spent on bribes to Colombian\nofficials yearly according to estimates by U.S. law enforcement\nofficials.  This level of influence has led some to declare that\nColombia is the world's first \"Narco-Democracy.\"  Evidence of\nbribery has extended throughout the Colombian government including\nthe former president of the national congress, congressmen, judges,\narmy officers, and policemen.  A comment by Cali cartel leader\nGilberto Rodrigez Orejuela illustrates this, \"We don't kill judges\nor ministers, we buy them.\"  A former DEA officer states the\nsituation just as clearly when he says that he \"cannot think of a\nsingle political or judicial institution that has not been\npenetrated by the narco-traffickers.\"  Even more importantly, the\nColombian constitution forbids the extradition of criminals.\n\n3.

Discourse and Status:  DISagreement and INPROGress\n\n     Coca growth has been a part of the Andean economy for\nthousands of years, but its growth has never been wide spread as\na cash crop until as recently as the 1970şs when the first large\nscale demand for cocaine occurred in the United States.  Largely\nthrough pressure from the United States, Colombia has adopted\nU.S. counter-narcotics techniques to compliment their outlawing\nof the growth of coca and the production of cocaine.  Though\nColombia is the largest producer and trafficker in cocaine, Peru\nis largest grower of coca.\n\n     Despite its efforts, Colombia has not constrained the flow\nof cocaine.  Indeed, Colombia seems to have lost ground to the\ndrug traffickers in several key areas.  The traffickers have\nexerted their influence over the new constitution in two ways.\nFirst,  the constitution forbids the extradition of drug\ntraffickers to the United States where they would receive\nlegitimate trials and severe sentencing if convicted.  The same\ndocument places a maximum of 12 years incarceration on drug\ntrafficking convictions.  The large amounts of money available\nto the drug traffickers ensures that they will be able to afford\nthe best lawyers for their defense, many of whom are former\nprosecutors.  This premium defense makes convictions difficult in\nthe United States and even more so in the corruptible courts of\nColombia.\n\n     Though domestic law indisputably classifies coca growth and\ncocaine processing as illegal, there has been pervasive popular\nresistance towards its actual implementation.  This resistance\nresulted in a provincial agreement by the government not to\ndestroy coca fields smaller than 3 hectares.  This agreement was\nbroken by the government due to pressure from the United\nStates.  A second attack on government eradication policies\ncame from environmentalist groups, allegedly in the pay of the\ndrug cartels,  which objected to the governmentşs spraying of the\nherbicide glyphosate on the grounds that it destroys the\nenvironment and is harmful to the health of the people living in\nthe region.  The accusations of these groups are weakened by the\nfact that this herbicide is fully approved by the USEPA, is used\nin over 100 nations world wide, and has received no similar\ncharges elsewhere.\n\n6.        Forum and Scope:  COLOMbia and REGIONal\n\n     The illegality of coca growth and cocaine production is\nofficially a strictly internal matter of the Colombian\ndetermination, which has decided to comply with the 1988 United\nNations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\nPsycotropic Substances.  However, the reality of the situation is\nquite different.  The United States has considerable influence\nover the drug policies pursued by Colombia, just as it has\nconsiderable influence through out the Western Hemisphere,\nthrough the distribution of aid and economic agreements.  The\nUnited States has also used limited military action to aid the\nDEA in crop destruction and drug seizures, but has withheld full\nmilitary action because of the diplomatic complications.\nColombia is not willing to give permission to the U.S. for an all\nout effort to eradicate the drug business.\n\n     The U.S. has passed judgment on drug producing nations since\n1986, essentially determining whether the country is contributing\nsufficient efforts towards counter-narcotics programs.  A failing\nrating strips the country of its foreign aid eligibility and\npreferred trade status, both of these being strong deterrents to\ndrug policy rebellion.\n\n7.        Decision Breadth:  Colombia and MANY\n\n8.        Legal Standing:  LAW and TREATY\n\n     It is against the law in Colombia to grow coca (since\n1947) and poppy or to produce cocaine or heroine, however this\nlaw is mostly enforced due to pressure induced by U.S. treaties\nrequiring full compliance with the 1988 United Nations Convention\nAgainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psycotropic\nSubstances.  The punishment for non-compliance with U.S. efforts\nor the UN Convention is the retraction of foreign aid and, for\nthe Andean Region, expulsion from the Andean Trade Preferences\nAct (essentially an agreement allowing barrier free access to\nU.S. markets, for products made by industries not considered\nthreatened by foreign trade or vital to U.S. interests, in return\nfor full compliance with the UN Convention).\n\nC.        GEOGRAPHIC Clusters\n\n9.        Geographic Locations\n\n     a.   Geographic Domain   :  South America [SAMER]\n     b.   Geographic Site     :  ANDES\n     c.   Geographic Impact   :  COLOMbia\n\n     This case study is concerned with Colombia, but other\nprincipal coca growers are Peru and Bolivia.  Indeed, the\ndamage in Peru is estimated to be higher than that in Colombia,\nas it is the worldşs major producer of coca (see COCA case on\nthis).\n\n10.       Sub-National Factors:  No\n\n     A provincial agreement had been reached protecting fields of\ndrug crops below a certain size from herbicidal spraying, but\nthis agreement was withdrawn.\n\n11.       Type of Habitat:  TROPical\n\nD.        TRADE Clusters\n\n12.       Type of Measure:  Export Ban [EXBAN]\n\n     Cocaine and heroin are controlled substances world-wide and\nany trafficking in them other than for specific medical purposes\nis strictly forbidden.\n\n13.       Direct vs. Indirect Impacts:  DIRect\n\n14.       Relation of Measure to Environmental Impact\n\n     a.   Directly Related    :  YES  COCA\n     b.   Indirectly Related  :  YES  FOOD\n     c.   Not Related         :  NO\n     d.   Process Related     :  YES  DEFORestation\n\n     The coca and poppy fields are not directly destructive to\nthe environment, it is the methods utilized in their cultivation\nthat result in the destruction.  The deforestation committed in\nclearing the fields, the chemical pollution from insecticides and\nfertilizers, and the soil erosion are inevitable with the current\nmethod of cultivation.  Additionally, the chemicals used in\nprocessing the raw crop into the narcotic are environmentally\nharmful as well.\n\n     Indirectly related to the problem is the situation of food\ncrops.  The farmers often have switched to growing drug crops for\neconomic reasons, placing a greater stress on the environment as\nthe farmers hunt to supplement their diets.  If the farmers do\ngrow subsistence crops in addition to their drug crops, both\ncrops are generally destroyed by drug enforcement officers\nthrough indiscriminate aerial spraying because the two fields are\neither overlapping or adjacent to one another.\n\n15.       Trade Product Identification:  COCA and products\n\n16.       Economic Data\n\n     In 1993 total legal exports from Colombia were $7.6\nbillion, During that same year the DEA estimated that Colombian\ndrug traffickers repatriated up to $7 billion in laundered drug\nmoney into the Colombian economy.  Essentially, the drug trade\nis returning as great a profit as the total exports of the\ncountry - with no recipients but the drug cartels who use that\nwealth to sustain their enterprise.  Is it any wonder that the\nGovernment has difficulty handling the situation?   In 1993, coca\nreturned a greater profit than any legally cultivated crop in\nColombia by 15%.  In fact, the only crop to return a greater\nprofit than coca was poppy, which returned a profit 22 percent\nhigher than coca.\n\n17.       Impact of Measure on Trade Competitiveness: MEDium\n\n     There are two arguments for the actual effects of the ban.\nFirst, that the ban raises the demand of the product to the\nextent that growing coca is too profitable for the farmer and\ntrafficker to forgo.  The opposing view believes that, without\nthe ban, demand for the product would skyrocket and, thus, its\nremoval would have little effect on driving prices down.\n\n18.       Industrial Sector:  PHARMaceutical\n\n     Coca and poppy growth is agricultural in nature, while the\nprocessing of the raw material into the final products is done in\nwhat is essentially a light chemical manufacturing process.\n\n19.       Exporter and Importers: COLOMbia and USA\n\n     Up to 20 percent of the Andean region is suitable for coca\nproduction with the primary producers of raw coca being Bolivia,\nColombia, and Peru.  However, the primary exporter of processed\ncocaine products is Colombia.  Primary importers of processed\ncocaine are the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and more\nrecently Eastern Europe.\n\nE.        ENVIRONMENT Clusters\n\n20.       Environmental Problem Type:  DEFORestation\n\n     Deforestation is occurring at a staggering pace in Colombia\nas coca and poppy growers increase the number of fields under\ncultivation and move from depleted land no longer able to support\nthe crop.  The effects of the crop field expansion are compounded\nby the fact that every planted hectare of coca or poppy requires\ntwo and one-half hectares of forest to be cut.  \"At the present\nrate of destruction... Colombia will lose a third of its\nremaining forests and jungles by the end of the century.\"\n\n     The habitat loss resulting from the coca and poppy\ncultivation stems from two characteristics of the farmerşs\ncultivation techniques.  Because the drug crops return a greater\nprofit than most legitimate crops, the farmers can purchase\nfertilizer that is not economical for legal crops.   Because the\nfertilizers create a greater yield, the farmers are not as\nconcerned about preserving the soil.  Also, the crop eradication\nby the Colombian government and the DEA does not allow the farmer\nthe luxury of anticipating a long term occupation of his field,\ntherefore the farmer is more concerned about short-term growth\nthan about sustainability.  To make access more difficult, the\nfarmer's plant their crops on freshly cleared hillsides aiding\nheavy soil erosion from wind and rain.\n\n     Nitrates used by coca and poppy growers as fertilizers\npollute the water ways causing fish deaths and spurring abnormal\nalgae growth.  The chemicals used in processing the raw products\ninto the drugs range from sulfuric acid to gasoline to sevin\n(which has been used to create poison gas in Iraq).  Estimates of\nchemical wastes dumped into the ground and streams are in excess\nof 200,000 tons per year.\n\n21.       Name, Type, and Diversity of Species\n\n     Name:          Coca\n     Type:          Plant\n     Diversity:     51,220 higher plants\n                    per 10,000 km/sq\n                    (Colombia)\n\n     The damage comes from the effects of the deforestation and\nchemical pollutants introduced into the environment from these\nactivities.  The waterways have been clogged with silt running\noff of the stripped hills and contaminated by the toxic chemicals\nbeing dumped into streams by drug processing plants.  As a\nresult, the fish population and aquatic plants have been\ndecimated to the point that Dr. Urrelo, an environmentalist\nworking in the area for the past 20 years, has declared the\n\"small rivers dead.\"\n\n     The deforestation and cultivation of drug crops is also\nhaving an effect on the wildlife of the area, particularly birds.\nThe lack of appropriate habitat has cut the diversity of the bird\npopulation dramatically according to environmentalist Dr. Hern,\nwho estimates it as low as 1 percent of its level 30 years ago.\nCompounding the reduction in habitat, the farmers of drug crops\noften do not grow subsistence crops and hunt the birds and other\nanimals as food.  Plant diversity is also suffering severely\nwith estimates stating that 1/3 of Colombiaşs total remaining\nforestry will be gone within the next five years.\n\n22.       Resource Impact and Effect: High and SCALE\n\n     Even at the current rate of deforestation over 1/3 of all of\nColombia's forest will be gone in 5 years, much of the cleared\nland being abandoned after two or three seasons due to flagging\nfertility.  Little wildlife exists in the rivers or the forests\nnear populated areas making life more difficult for those not\nparticipating in the drug trade to prosper or even survive.  The\nsoils in the tropical region of Colombia are sand and poor for\nplant growth underneath the thin topsoil.  The deforestation\ncaused by coca and poppy producers and non-existent soil\nconservation techniques they practice have led several experts to\ntheorize that the region could end up in a situation similar to\nthat of Ethiopia or Somalia within 50 years, i.e. a fast growing\npopulation that is larger than the food production can support\ndue to poor agricultural soils or techniques.\n\n23.       Urgency and Lifetime:  MEDium and 100s of years\n\n     Tropical jungles are one of the most delicate ecosystems on\nthe planet, easily disrupted and extremely difficult to restore\nonce harmed.  The jungle is being destroyed at a rapid rate and\nin a manner which makes recovery extremely difficult.  The soil\nerosion and destruction of soil microbes necessary for plant\ngrowth make this recovery process even longer and more\ndifficult.\n\n24.       Substitutes:  REHABilitation\n\n     In this case study there are two aspects to be addressed for\nsubstitutional products.  The first environmental effect of the\ncoca and poppy growth deals with deforestation, soil erosion, and\nreductions in bio-diversity.  The jungle environment of South\nAmerica contributes significant supplies of the worldşs oxygen\nand includes a large proportion of the worldşs species of both\nplants and animals, neither of these can be substituted for.\nThey can be nurtured back to health if given enough care and\nactive cooperation by the farmers and general industry that use\nthe forest land, including the coca and poppy growers.  The\nsecond possibility is finding a substitute for cocaine, heroine,\npoppy or coca.  The substitution of the drug crops or the\nprocessed drugs would solve some of the environmental\ndegradation, however, most would find this solution unacceptable\nbecause it would not solve the social problems related to drug\nabuse.  Rehabilitation has proven to be a problematic solution as\nmost of the patients require multiple sessions of treatment.\nEven though they do become \"clean\" for a time, upon leaving the\nconfines of the treatment center the circumstances which\nencourage them to  abuse drugs remain unchanged.\n\nF.        OTHER FACTORS\n\n25.       Culture:  Yes\n\n     The traditional coca leaf use extends back at least to 2,100\nBC in the Andes, according to archaeological finds.  During the\npast 4,000 years coca has established a solid niche in the\neveryday life of rural Andean people, both Indian and those\nEuropeans living there for centuries.  The coca leaf contains\nless than 1% cocaine and has much the same effect as caffeine,\ntherefore, even though cocaine is processed from coca leaves the\ntwo products are dramatically different in effects and usage.\nThe use of the coca leaf may be mildly addictive, an effect such\nas caffeine addiction, but not to the damaging level of cocaine\nor heroine consumption.  Traditionally, the coca leaf has been\nchewed to relieve fatigue and hunger, as it is a mild stimulant.\nIt also has medical applications through helping to relieve\naltitude sickness and conserve body heat.  It also provides some\nessential vitamins when consumed.  These three characteristics\nare particularly useful in the mountainous Andes.  The coca leaf\nis also integral to a number of religious and cultural\nceremonies.\n\n26.       Trans-Boundary:  Yes\n\n     The drug trade is an international problem of both supply\nand demand.  Cocaine and heroine permeates nearly every nation on\nthe globe, either as a grower, a consumer, or a routing nexus\nbetween the two.\n\n27.       Human Rights:  Yes\n\n     There is a basic freedom issue between the consumption of\ndrugs and their growth or the protection of society as a\nresponsibility of the government to its citizens.\n\n28.

    "content": "The University of Manitoba is using anti-cheating software that records students' webcams during some remote exams to ensure academic integrity during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut an ethicist and the students union are raising concerns about the program's artificial intelligence and webcam monitoring abilities, which use facial detection, motion and keyboard activity to catch cheaters. \n\nThe program the U of M has been piloting during summer courses is called Respondus and has already been used at other schools in Canada. The school is now making the software available during the fall term for optional use by instructors at the U of M.\n\n\"What is a little bit troublesome is there's a lack of clarity on where these things are being stored and who can access [them] outside of the institution itself,\" said Jelynn Dela Cruz, president of the University of Manitoba Students' Union.\n\nThe union has heard concerns about the software from students in recent days, she said, and is now in talks with university administration about the program, which locks down a student's screen, uses advanced algorithms for facial detection, motion, and data from the computer to identify patterns and anomalies associated with cheating. Dela Cruz said not every professor is using the software. Instead, some are choosing to use another program during exams that have all students in a class visible on webcam. \n\n\"Students have come to us voicing concerns about their classmates watching them during the exam, especially if they have accessibility needs that they're not necessarily comfortable sharing with the rest of the class.\"\n\nThe University of Manitoba has told faculty the program went through a rigorous evaluation before being approved.\n\n\"This software has undergone all the required considerations for privacy and security,\" U of M spokesperson Chris Rutkowski told CBC.\n\nHe said Respondus files are kept under secure means in the company's cloud, are not stored locally and are removed after the university's appeal period.He added that since students are watched by their peers in classes, it \"is also anticipated that students would prefer to focus on writing their exams and not be watching their classmates.\"\n\nBut U of M associate professor Neil McArthur, who is an ethicist, said he won't be using the software this fall.\n\n\"To have software that not only locks a student's computer but monitors their eye movements and their physical movements I think is a clear violation of privacy,\" he said.\n\nMcArthur said even if the U of M asks for students' consent before using the program, it's problematic in his view. \n\n\"The consent is complicated because what they're consenting to is in a sense coerced in that they need to compete for this in order to get to pass the course and write the exam.\"\n\nHe said instead of using the anti-cheating software, he will give students take-home exams they have 24 hours to complete.\n\n\"I try to give exam questions that are specifically tailored to the class material, so that you know, if they want to spend that 24 hours cramming desperately and reading all the class material if they haven't done that up till now, that's fine, because what they're doing basically is doing the course, which is what I want them to do.\" \n\nThe University of Regina said it is using anti-cheating software as a pilot with this summer's final exams.\n\nThe University of Winnipeg said a few departments are currently using live proctoring on Zoom while students are writing tests. it is investigating invigilation software and plans to run a pilot with it in a few courses this fall.\n\n\"Our faculty members are looking both at invigilation methods and a test construction that will inhibit opportunities to cheat, as well as alternative types of evaluation that don't involve a set test or exam,\" said U of W spokesperson Kevin Rosen.\n\nRed River College said it is not using anti-cheating software and instead is taking a proactive approach toward academic integrity. \"Our approach includes increased education and access to supports for students, anchored by an online learning module and class sessions to outline the risks and consequences to cheating,\" said college spokesperson Conor Lloyd in an email.\n\n\"By increasing the ways in which we evaluate students, we are able to provide more comprehensive assessments and take the weight off of a single exam. Our ultimate goal with this approach is to discourage cheating online and ensuring our students can access resources and supports early on to help them with their programs this fall.\"\n\nRespondus COO Jodi Feeney said its programs are designed with student privacy as a basic requirement.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the company had business relationships with the majority of Canadian universities, she said.\n\nThe company also said that just because students get a proctoring flag when they move away from their computers, it doesn't necessarily mean they'll get bad grades. \n\n\"For example, if the student goes to the door because someone is knocking on it, a flag is likely to appear in the proctoring results. However, when the instructor sees what happened in that segment of the video, the flag is likely to be ignored,\" company CEO David Smetters said in a statement.",

Last year, Pope Francis blessed a bell which has now traveled to nearly 30 cities in Poland to be rung in support of the unborn.“Today I blessed the bells that bear the name: ‘The voice of the unborn,’” Pope Francis said in a greeting to Polish pilgrims during his general audience in the Paul VI Hall.\n\n“They are destined for Ecuador and Ukraine. For these nations and for all they are a sign of commitment in favor of the defense of human life from conception to natural death,” he said.\n\n“May their sound announce the ‘Gospel of life’ to the world, awaken the consciences of men, and be a reminder of the unborn,” he added. “I entrust to your prayer every conceived child whose life is sacred and inviolable.”\n\nOne bell will be given to the St. John Paul II Shrine in Lviv, Ukraine, and the other will go to the Diocese of Guayaquil in Ecuador. The bells will travel to various events in those cities so that people can ring them as an expression of their pro-life beliefs.The bells, like the original in Poland, were cast in the bell-making workshop of Jan Felczyński in the southeastern city of Przemyśl. They each weigh more than 2,000 pounds and are nearly four feet in diameter.\n\nThey are decorated with a DNA chain and an ultrasound of an unborn child. There is also an image of the stone tables on which God gave Moses the 10 Commandments. The bells bear the words of the fifth commandment -- “Thou shalt not kill” -- in Spanish and Ukrainian.The words of Jeremiah 1:5 -- “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I dedicated you” -- are also written on the bells beneath the image of the ultrasound.\n\nThey also have a quote from St. Pope John Paul II's encyclical Evangelium vitae: “respect, protect, love and serve life, every human life!”",

    "content": "Prospects of an agreement between the EU and the UK that would prevent a chaotic British exit from the bloc appear increasingly dim, as talks between the two sides reach an impasse and European leaders express doubts about striking a deal in time before the October 31 deadline.   \n\nAs politicians seem unable to reach an acceptable accord, concerns mount in the business world that a disorderly British departure could wreak havoc on firms on both sides of the English Channel, causing job losses and damaging supply chain relationships cultivated over decades.\n\nRead more: Another brick in the wall? The downside of Britain's jobs boom\n\n\"A disorderly Brexit seems more likely than ever,\" Holger Bingmann, president of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services (BGA), told Germany's Rheinische Post newspaper on Monday. \n\nHe warned that a hard Brexit would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for Germany's exporters, pointing out that they would face \"immense additional costs\" in terms of customs and the bureaucracy of logistics, transportation, data protection and taxes. \n\nBrexit has cast its shadow on UK-Germany trade for the past couple of years, Bingmann said. The expert noted that in the first half of this year alone, German exporters to the UK incurred losses worth over €3.5 billion ($3.85 billion) on account of Brexit-related negative effects.\n\nThe true extent of the damage to bilateral commerce is likely to be \"much greater and will only become visible in a few months,\" he said, as many firms have just replenished their stocks in the UK to prevent disruptions to the supply chain in the coming months.\n\nRepeated warnings\n\nBusinesses and industry groups in both the UK and continental Europe have repeatedly warned about the potential adverse impact of a chaotic Brexit.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said in September that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is damaging business confidence. According to the lobby group, British firms are diverting billions of pounds from productive investment to preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"Until a deal is agreed, companies will continue to divert billions of pounds from productive investment to no deal preparations, and international investors will continue to question if the UK is a stable, open place to do business,\" CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said.\n\nCBI said British firms remain concerned about the ongoing political uncertainty in the UK.\n\nGerman business groups say the Brexit withdrawal agreement, negotiated by UK PM Boris Johnson's predecessor Theresa May, should not be renegotiated.\n\n\"We've spent a lot of money on the issue of Brexit. Instead we should prepare to strengthen Europe,\" the managing director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), an influential German business lobby group, told DW in July. \"We see we are walking toward a bilateral world in which the US and China are predominant and we should all unite to build a strong Europe. It's a waste of money, it's a waste of time. Instead we should combine our forces.\"\n\nDefiant tone from London\n\nJohnson has so far struck a defiant tone, saying the UK will leave the EU as planned on October 31, irrespective of whether Brussels accepts London's latest proposals for a deal.\n\nThe British premier told French President Emmanuel Macron by phone that the EU shouldn't be \"lured into the mistaken belief that the UK will stay in the EU after October 31,\" his office said.\n\n\"We will be packing our bags and walking out,\" Johnson wrote in an op-ed published by Britain's Sun newspaper on Sunday. \"The only question is whether Brussels cheerily waves us off with a mutually agreeable deal, or whether we will be forced to head off on our own.\"\n\nSlowing German economy\n\nGermany's export-reliant manufacturers, meanwhile, are suffering not just from the UK's planned departure from the EU. They're also facing increased headwinds from a slowing global economy and growing business uncertainty over trade and tariff disagreements between the US and China.\n\nOfficial statistics released on Monday showed that factory orders in Europe's biggest economy slumped more than forecast in August. Industrial orders fell by 0.6% month-on-month, the Economy Ministry said, after a hefty 2.1% drop in July. Analysts had expected a 0.3% fall in August.\n\nThe figures come after the German economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter. Experts believe data will show an additional slowdown between July and September.\n\nLeading economic institutes have recently slashed their growth forecasts for the economy for this year and next. But the labor market has so far appeared to be robust, with record-high employment in the country.\n\nEven though calls for increased government spending to boost growth are growing louder, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has so far stuck to its balanced budget policy.",

    "content": "Protesters in Ecuador have released 10 police officers who were taken hostage amid violent demonstrations triggered by austerity measures.\n\nIndigenous demonstrators paraded the officers, including one woman, on a stage in Quito before a crowd.\n\nBefore being freed, some of the officers were forced to carry the coffin of an indigenous activist allegedly killed during the unrest.\n\nPresident Lenín Moreno was forced to move the government out of the capital.\n\nThe protesters, led by indigenous groups, are demanding the return of fuel subsidies, scrapped by the government last week. Some have called for the resignation of the president, who has declared a two-month national emergency.On Thursday, the officers were detained at a cultural centre in Quito that has been used by thousands of indigenous protesters as their base since they arrived in the city last weekend.\n\nHours later in an evening address, Interior Minister María Paula Romo said they had been released along with some 30 journalists who were covering the incident and who had also been prevented from leaving the building.Indigenous leaders - who have complained of excessive police force - say Inocencio Tucumbí, whose coffin was taken to the centre, died after being hit by a tear gas canister fired by the police at a protest on Wednesday.\n\nBut Ms Romo said Tucumbí died from a fall, without giving further details. Three other people have died as a result of the unrest so far, she said, adding that some 650 people have been detained by police.\n\nPresident Moreno has said he will not quit and, without offering evidence, has accused his predecessor Rafael Correa and Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of plotting to oust him.\n\nThe United Nations said it was ready to mediate after receiving a request from the government.\n\nPresentational grey line\nUncompromising rhetoric\nBy Will Grant, BBC Latin America correspondent\n\nThe police officers held by the protesters were forced on to a stage and made to remove their helmets, bullet-proof vests and boots.\n\nThe officers look visibly worried as they were paraded in front of an angry crowd in which many were incensed at several days of a heavy-handed police response to the demonstrations.\n\nPresident Moreno has been pushing for further talks with the indigenous leaders but the rhetoric coming from the groups that took the police officers is uncompromising.\n\nWith some pushing for nothing less than the president's resignation, it seems there will be more protests to come over the weekend: \"We're going to radicalise with more force,\" an indigenous leader, Jaime Vargas, told the crowd.\n\nPresentational grey line\nWhat's the background?\nProtests began after the government announced an end to fuel subsidies as part of public spending cuts agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in return for a loan. The deal reached in March will allow Ecuador to borrow $4.2bn (£3.4bn).\n\nMr Moreno has said the fuel subsidies, introduced in the 1970s with an annual cost of $1.3bn, were no longer affordable. Eliminating them is part of his plan to shore up Ecuador's flagging economy and ease its debt burden.\n\nPetrol prices soared and thousands took to the streets. In recent days, they set up barricades, stormed buildings and clashed with security forces, who have tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas.\n\nProtesters have also entered some oil fields, impacting production of the Andean nation, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nIndigenous-led protests toppled three presidents in the past few decades. Since the current unrest began, protesters have taken dozens of officers hostage in various locations throughout the country .",

    "content": "When Saudi Arabia’s King Salman landed in Indonesia on Wednesday, he became the first Saudi monarch to visit the world’s largest Muslim-majority country since 1970. Officials in Jakarta had hoped the visit would help them strengthen business ties and secure $25 billion in resource investments. That’s largely been a bust—as of Thursday, the kingdom has agreed to just one new deal, for a relatively paltry $1 billion.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia has, for decades, been making investments of a different sort—those aimed at influencing Indonesian culture and religion. The king’s current visit is the apex of that methodical campaign, and “has the potential to accelerate the expansion of Saudi Arabia’s cultural resources in Indonesia,” according to Chris Chaplin, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asia. “In fact, given the size of his entourage, I wouldn’t be surprised if there will be a flurry of networking activity amongst Indonesian alumni of Saudi universities.”Since 1980, Saudi Arabia has devoted millions of dollars to exporting its strict brand of Islam, Salafism, to historically tolerant and diverse Indonesia. It has built more than 150 mosques (albeit in a country that has about 800,000), a huge free university in Jakarta, and several Arabic language institutes; supplied more than 100 boarding schools with books and teachers (albeit in a country estimated to have between 13,000 and 30,000 boarding schools); brought in preachers and teachers; and disbursed thousands of scholarships for graduate study in Saudi Arabia. All this adds up to a deep network of Saudi influence.\n\n“The advent of Salafism in Indonesia is part of Saudi Arabia’s global project to spread its brand of Islam throughout the Muslim world,” said Din Wahid, an expert on Indonesian Salafism at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University (UIN) in Jakarta.\n\nSalaf is Arabic for “forebear,” and Salafism is a Sunni movement that advocates a return to the Islamic traditions of the Prophet Muhammad and his contemporaries. It arose in reaction to 18th-century European colonialism in the Middle East, but it took particular root in Saudi Arabia in the hands of the influential preacher Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Al-Wahhab’s alliance with the House of Saud in 1744 cemented Wahhabism as the spiritual backbone of the Saudi Arabian state. And in the 20th century, Saudi Arabia, which had become fabulously oil-rich, started to invest its considerable resources in propagating its ideology abroad.\n\nThe heart of Indonesian Salafism is the Institute for the Study of Islam and Arabic (LIPIA), a completely Saudi-funded university in South Jakarta whose campus was abuzz the day before the king’s visit.\n\n“It’s really great that our two countries are becoming closer,” said one student who, like most of the other male students at LIPIA, had a wispy beard and wore cropped pants, per hadith verses stating that covering one’s ankles connotes arrogance. “I’ve been reading all the news about the royal visit. I hope to further my own studies in Saudi Arabia, God willing.”\n\nLIPIA’s doors opened in 1980. Its ostensible purpose is to spread the Arabic language, and there’s not a word of the country’s official language, Bahasa Indonesia, on its campus—not a bathroom sign, not a library book. Tuition at LIPIA is free for all its 3,500 students. Music is considered bid’ah, an unnecessary innovation, and is prohibited, along with television and loud laughter. Men and women do not interact; classes of male students attend live lectures on one floor while female students watch the same lecture, live-streamed, on a separate floor.\n\nIndonesia’s Ministry of Religious Affairs accredited LIPIA in 2015, which bodes well for the university’s push to open four more branches across the archipelago. Hammed al-Sultan, head of LIPIA’s Arabic language department, was confident that the satellite campuses would open by the fall of this year. But they will need their own green lights from the ministry, which has voiced concerns about whether they will uphold moderate Islam and Indonesia’s state philosophy of Pancasila, which enshrines religious tolerance.\n\nWhen I asked whether LIPIA Jakarta already does this, al-Sultan said, “Pancasila … sorry, what is that again?” A LIPIA representative acting as our translator quickly briefed him on it. Al-Sultan said, “Yes, our integration of Pancasila is in progress, since it was a requirement for our accreditation two years ago.”\n\nMuhammad Adlin Sila of the Ministry of Religious Affairs was more frank. “We are concerned about some alumni from LIPIA who are big fans of khilafah [the caliphate of the Islamic State].”\n\nUlil-Abshar Abdalla, a LIPIA alumnus who now runs the Liberal Islam Network, said he found the university’s theological climate oppressive when he attended in the early 1990s. “Theology, which is a mandatory subject there, is only taught by committed Wahhabis, and I really think their ideology is antithetical to traditional Indonesian Islam, which is usually syncretic and relaxed,” he explained.Beyond LIPIA, hundreds of Indonesians receive scholarships to study at Saudi universities every year. A few decades in, alumni of these programs are becoming nationally influential in their home country. Habib Rizieq, the founder of the Islamic Defenders Front, a hardline organization associated with religion-related violence, attended both LIPIA and King Saud University in Riyadh. Jafar Umar Thalib, who founded the militant Salafi group Laskar Jihad, also graduated from LIPIA. Right-wing Islamist leaders like Hidayat Nur Wahid, a member of parliament who earned three degrees on scholarship from the University of Medina, are prominent in mainstream politics.\n\nLIPIA alumni have also set up pesantren, or Islamic boarding schools, across Indonesia. Many of the country’s 100-odd Salafi pesantren are supplied by Saudi Arabia with teachers, especially of Arabic language, and textbooks, according to Din Wahid. For many poor families, these pesantren are the only feasible option for their kids’ schooling, despite ideological quibbles, Wahid said.\n\nEnterprising Saudi envoys have even made inroads in places like Aceh, the westernmost Indonesian province that’s been wracked by natural disasters like the 2005 tsunami. “We have built mosques, hospitals, and schools there,” the Saudi ambassador to Indonesia, Mohammad Abdullah Alshuaibi, told me. “And an Arabic language institute.”\n\nOne reason Indonesia has been reluctant to push back on Saudi cultural advances is the all-important hajj quota, the number of citizens who can make pilgrimage to Mecca in a given year. Indonesia gets the largest allowance in the world: 221,000 this year. But decade-long hajj waiting lists are common in many provinces, and jeopardizing the national allowance could provoke a huge backlash, said Dadi Darmadi, a UIN researcher and hajj expert.\n\n“That being said, the Indonesian government has to be more wise and stop considering the hajj quota as a political gambit to attract more populist support in this country,” Darmadi said.\n\nNearly every Indonesian leader, from the president to the foreign minister to the Speaker of the House, has cited the hajj quota as an important focus of King Salman’s trip.\n\nThe first big policy objective announced for the visit, however, addressed not the hajj, but terrorism. A “pact to combat terrorism” will be the “centerpiece” of agreements signed in Indonesia this week, the Saudi ambassador, Alshuaibi, told reporters on Tuesday.We need King Salman to make a clear and bold statement denouncing radicalism.”\nIt’s ironic, then, that some of Indonesia’s leading jihadists have passed through Saudi institutions. Although Salafism is largely “quietist,” or discouraging of political activity, there is a growing faction of Salafi jihadists in Indonesia, according to Din Wahid. In 1972, Saudi money helped to found the “ivy league” of jihadist pesantren, the Al-Mukmin school in Ngruki, Central Java. The Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah received funding from Saudi charities in the early 2000s. Salafi TV, YouTube channels, Facebook groups, and Telegram channels have become a fertile ground for female extremists and ISIS sympathizers in Indonesia in the last few years, according to a 2017 report from the Institute of Policy Analysis and Conflict (IPAC).\n\n“We’ve been seeing some evidence of the transition from Salafism to extremism among female extremists of the ISIS generation,” said Nava Nuraniyah, an IPAC researcher. “On the other hand, though, Salafi ulama [scholars] in Indonesia are among the most vocal opponents of extremism,” she said, suggesting that Salafism acts as a bridge to extremism for some even as it acts as a deterrent for others.\n\nSaudi Arabia has long pushed the notion that its rigorous, state-sanctioned version of Islam is actually a bulwark against violent extremism, and has partnered with countries like the United States to fight terrorist groups from al-Qaeda to ISIS. But as Indonesia’s recent history shows, the distinction between Salafism and jihadism is not clear-cut.\n\n“We need King Salman to make a clear and bold statement denouncing radicalism,” said Yahya Cholil Staquf of the moderate Muslim organization Nahdlatul Ulama. Otherwise, he said, “His visit will be easily perceived as more support to radical Islamic movements in Indonesia, as it is already a common public understanding that those radical movements take theological reference from Saudi Wahhabism and have been enjoying various kinds of support from Saudi Arabia.”\n\nThe Saudi ambassador, for his part, thinks such fears about the ideological impact of Saudi investment are off-base. “Wahhabi, Wahhabi, Wahhabi… people love to throw around this term without knowing what it means!” Alshuaibi told me. “They make baseless accusations. It is crazy!”\n\nAnd some Indonesian leaders remain cautiously optimistic about closer ties with Saudi Arabia. “The two countries face the same challenge of rising radicalism and intolerance, so cooperation in those areas will be beneficial,” Yenny Wahid, a moderate Muslim activist, told Reuters.\n\nIndonesia may be the largest stage for Saudi Arabia’s cultural diplomacy, but it’s hardly the only one. Saudi Arabia built satellite campuses for Egypt’s Al-Azhar university in the 1980s, funded Bosnian rebels and later built them schools in the 1990s, bankrolled numerous madrassas in pre-Taliban Pakistan and Afghanistan, and sent 25,000 clerics to India between 2011 and 2013. Al-Hattem, of LIPIA Jakarta, was previously stationed at Saudi outfits in Bosnia and Djibouti.\n\nObservers have commented that the scales of power seem to be shifting in the Indonesia-Saudi relationship, so that the former is now theoretically in a better position to resist unwanted expansion than it was in the early years of its republic.\n\n“Our economic condition now is very different, almost reversed, since the last Saudi visit,” said Luthfi Assyanukie, a liberal Muslim academic. “I think we can utilize that to prudently regulate Saudi investments.” Sila, from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, said, “I think the Saudi government needs Indonesia more now than vice versa, not least in terms of the revenue from hajj pilgrims.”\n\nAs Saudi Arabia’s economy fluctuates and it enforces austerity measures at home, will it ramp up its global efforts or scale them back? It may not matter.\n\n“Salafi pesantren, and Saudi-inspired religious education in general, no longer necessarily rely on Saudi donations, as followers have become incredibly adept at raising money locally,” Chaplin said.\n\nAs the rise of hardliners, the Arabic language, and Salafi jihadist cells in Indonesia show, Salafism has some undeniable, durable appeal here. In Indonesia, at least, Saudi Arabia is already seeing the fruits of its labor. This new religious ecosystem may be self-sustaining.",

    "content": "Miami Dolphins general manager Chris Grier is moving and shaking.\n\nAfter trading the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft to the San Francisco 49ers, the Dolphins leaped back into the top 10 of the draft with another Friday blockbuster trade with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nMiami acquired the No. 6 overall pick and 156th selection (fifth round) from the Eagles in exchange for the No. 12 pick (acquired in the trade with the Niners), No. 123 (fourth round) and a 2022 first-round pick, Philadelphia announced.\n\nThe swap came after the Dolphins shipped the third pick to San Francisco in exchange for the 12th selection in 2021, a third-rounder in 2022 and first-round picks in 2022 and 2023, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, per a source informed of the situation.\n\nThe trade doublet amounts to a three-team swap when it's all said and done. The 49ers get the No. 3 pick this year. The Dolphins end up with the No. 6 overall pick in 2021, a 2023 first-rounder, a 2022 third and a fifth-rounder this year. The Eagles get the 12th pick, a fourth-round selection this season and a 2022 first-rounder.\n\nNFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported the Eagles' first-rounder acquired in 2022 would be Miami's, not the one the Dolphins received from San Francisco.\n\nSitting with the third pick thanks to the Laremy Tunsil trade with Houston, the Dolphins did well to stay inside the top 10 while picking up future assets. Dropping just three spots, Miami keeps itself positioned to take a high-caliber Day 1 starter. With a run on QBs now a virtual certainty, the Dolphins could land a player like Ja'Marr Chase, Kyle Pitts, Jaylen Waddle or potentially one of the top offensive lineman if they slide past the Bengals and Falcons.Trading all the way down the No. 12 would have taken Miami out of the running for one of the elite players, so jumping back up to No. 6 is a good use of assets by Grier. It's also possible Miami isn't done wheeling and dealing with 34 days left until Draft Day.\n\nFor the Eagles, the trade gives GM Howie Roseman additional chips to play with this season and, perhaps more importantly, next year, when Philly could have three first-rounders -- the ﻿Carson Wentz﻿ trade included a conditional first-rounder based on playing time. It's also possible that Roseman is stockpiling for another big move.\n\nRapoport reported the Eagles considered trying to trade up to draft Zach Wilson, but given the cost of moving up, felt it was better to move back and add a future first-rounder. The BYU quarterback is expected to go early in the draft, potentially as high as No. 2 overall, where the New York Jets currently sit.\n\nTrading down in the draft further cements ﻿Jalen Hurts﻿' place as Philly's starting quarterback to open the 2021 season -- as we currently sit. Recently signed veteran ﻿Joe Flacco﻿ is expected to be the backup. At No. 6 overall, Philly could have been in a position to draft a QB if Roseman believed there was an upgrade over Hurts. At No. 12, that scenario is far less likely to unfold, with clubs already lining themselves up to snag signal-callers very early in the first round.",

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing €13.9 billion in grants and €2.7 billion in loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) over the period 2021-2026. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Portugal to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe RRF - at the heart of NextGenerationEU - will provide up to €672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Portuguese plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market.\n\nThe Commission assessed Portugal's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms contained in Portugal's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience.\n\nSecuring Portugal's green and digital transition  \n\nThe Commission's assessment finds that Portugal's plan devotes 38% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes investments to finance a large-scale renovation programme to increase the energy efficiency of buildings or the promotion of energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources in industrial processes.\n\nThe Commission finds that the Portugal's plan devotes 22% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. This includes efforts to digitalise the public administration and to modernise the computer systems of the National Health Service, as well as technological laboratories in secondary schools and professional training centres.\n\nReinforcing Portugal's economic and social resilience\n\nThe Commission considers that Portugal's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Portugal by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures in the areas of accessibility and resilience of social services and the health system, labour market, education and skills, R&D and innovation, climate and digital transition, business environment, quality and sustainability of public finances and efficiency of the justice system.\n\nThe plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Portugal's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation.\n\nSupporting flagship investment and reform projects\n\nPortugal's plan proposes projects in six European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects, which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the green and digital transition. For instance, Portugal has proposed to provide €610 million to renovate public and private buildings to improve their energy performance. This will result in Portugal reducing its energy bill, greenhouse gas emissions and energy dependence, as well as reducing energy poverty.\n\nThe assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation.\n\nThe control systems put in place by Portugal are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: “Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Portugal's €16.6 billion recovery and resilience plan, the first to be endorsed by the Commission. The plan was designed in Portugal. The reforms and investments contained in this plan will allow Portugal to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the future. In short, it will help build a better future for the Portuguese people. We will stand by Portugal every step of the way. Your success will be our success. A European success.”\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: “Portugal was the first country to present its plan and today we are happy to confirm our positive assessment. This is a solid plan that will put Portugal on a path of higher growth, create new jobs for the future as well as stronger and sustainable social protection. The proposed measures cover a broad spectrum of reforms and investments to equip Portugal for the green and digital transition, ranging from digitalising the public administration, improving workers' skills, creating energy-efficient housing, to better protecting the country's vast forests. I also welcome the plan's strong social focus, including measures to improve childcare and strengthen the health care system. This plan will allow Portugal to grow back stronger. We will now work closely with Portugal on its full implementation.”\n\nPaolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: “The reforms and investments included in the Portuguese plan will enhance the country's resilience and give a strong boost to its climate transition and digital transformation efforts. With its measures to support social services, the national health service and education and training, the plan also has a very strong social dimension. This is our first completed assessment of a national recovery and resilience plan, marking a key milestone in the implementation of NextGenerationEU. And it is fitting that the first plan to be assessed positively is Portugal's: not only because it was the first to be submitted, but also because the Portuguese Presidency played such a key role in putting in place the legal and financial framework for this unprecedented common European endeavour.”\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide €13.9 billion in grants and €2.7 billion in loans to Portugal under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal.\n\nThe Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of €2.2 billion to Portugal in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Portugal.\n\nThe Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.",

    "content": "Clashes broke out Sunday morning in three cities across Israel as police attempted to enforce coronavirus lockdown restrictions in a number of ultra-Orthodox communities.\n\nIn the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim, hundreds of people clashed with police attempting to shut down a yeshiva that had opened illegally.\n\nPolice said that officers who arrived at the yeshiva, or religious seminary, were quickly surrounded by a crowd shouting insults at them and throwing trash and other debris in their direction.\n\nVideo of the incident showed a number of people calling the officers “Nazis” and “kapos,” the name for Jewish collaborators coerced into service by the Third Reich.\n\nPolice said one person was arrested and water cannon trucks were later brought in to disperse the crowd.In the southern coastal city of Ashdod, police were confronted while closing down studies at an ultra-Orthodox elementary school that had opened despite Health Ministry and Education Ministry rules preventing in-person studies.Police said “several dozen people who arrived on the scene tried to force their way into the compound and confronted the officers inside.” Police added that the intruders injured four officers and caused damage to the fence surrounding the school.\n\nProtesters who had gathered outside also blocked traffic and confronted police officers, the statement said. Four people were arrested.In the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, several clashes reportedly broke out as police tried to shut down schools linked to the Vizhnitz Hasidic dynasty, whose head rabbi on Saturday ruled that educational institutions should open, before apparently backtracking hours later.\n\nPolice said in response to the violence that they would continue to enforce virus restrictions, “in all communities.”The lockdown, in its third week and extended till January 31, has shuttered all nonessential businesses along with the entire education system, excluding special education. Some ultra-Orthodox schools, however, have continued to operate in violation of the rules.Last week clashes broke out between police and rioters opposed to coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Bnei Brak after a mob in the city injured a police officer on patrol. At least six people were arrested for disturbing the peace. Those rioters belonged to an extremist faction of the Vizhnitz Hasidic sect, according to Hebrew media reports.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the Friday attack in Bnei Brak, stating that “we will act with a heavy hand against lawbreakers, first and foremost against those who raised their hands against our policewomen and policemen.”\n\nCritics have accused Netanyahu of avoiding cracking down on the Haredi public in order not to anger his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners.\n\nAdditional reports of lockdown violations among the ultra-Orthodox emerged Saturday, including a mass gathering over the weekend in the Sanz Hasidic sect in Netanya. Other sects are expected to hold prayers and gatherings this week.On Thursday, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein called for jailing those who broke lockdown rules.\n\nNetanyahu and Edelstein made appeals last week to Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, a leading ultra-Orthodox rabbi, asking that he influence the community to obey the lockdown. According to the Haaretz daily on Saturday, Kanievsky gave permission for some ultra-Orthodox schools to reopen this week, but only if it does not spark a confrontation with police. The report said some schools were hesitant to reopen despite his approval.Haredi communities have suffered disproportionately from the coronavirus, with infection rates in many ultra-Orthodox areas several times that of non-Haredi areas. High infection rates among Haredim are partly due to large family size and environmental factors, but experts also blame rule-breaking in large pockets of the community, often supported by rabbis and other community leaders.\n\nThe Health Ministry on Sunday reported a further decline in daily coronavirus infections the day before, as Israel’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began appeared to ease after weeks of strict lockdown rules and as the vaccination program continued to be rolled out.\n\nAccording to the ministry, 2,394 new cases were confirmed Saturday, after peaking at over 10,100 a week earlier. Sunday’s numbers are usually lower due to reduced testing at the weekend.\n\nThe total number of infections recorded in Israel reached 595,097, and the death toll stood at 4,361.\n\nThe ministry said there were 75,053 active cases, with 1,822 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Of those, 1,228 were in serious condition.",

It was organised by civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III - the eldest son of Mr King Jr.\n\nThe families of black Americans shot or killed by police spoke at the same site where Martin Luther King Jr delivered his I Have a Dream speech.The 1963 March on Washington was a seismic event in US history, credited with spurring the passage of the Civil Rights Act outlawing segregation the following year.\n\nSome 250,000 supporters packed the 1.9 miles (3 km) strip from Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument, making it one of the largest political gatherings the country had ever seen.\n\nRev Sharpton announced the 2020 march - which falls on the 57th anniversary of the 1963 event - at Mr Floyd's memorial service in June.\n\nHis organisation, the National Action Network, worked with Mr King III to convene the rally.\"The nation has never seen such a mighty movement, a modern day incarnation of what my father called the coalition of conscience,\" said Mr King III.\n\n\"And if we move forward with purpose and passion, we will complete the work so boldly began in the 1960s.\"The event comes in the wake of at times violent protests over Mr Blake's shooting that have left two dead in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

That's not normal.\"\n\n\"Clearly with the way that the police have been behaving in different areas of the country, they're looking at us as targets and we can't have that,\" he continued. \"It contradicts the entire American dream.\"\n\nPolice violence against African-Americans is top of mind today for many marchers.\n\nArtelia Bryant, from Roanoke, Virginia, says in her opinion, little has changed since 1963.\n\nBryant wants lawmakers and law enforcement held accountable for the deaths of black people in police custody.\n\nWhere do they start?\n\n\"Cops being arrested,\" says Bryant. \"They can start with the cops that killed Breonna Taylor.\"\n\nMany called for the immediate passage of national police reform legislation known as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named after the late civil rights icon and congressman.\n\nPatrick Reyes travelled to Washington from Brooklyn, New York. He points out the 57 years since the first March on Washington saw seminal policies like the Voting Rights Act - a landmark law designed to protect minority voters - but says empty legislation has followed since then: \"Voter suppression still exists today.\"\n\n\"We're not asking for it, we're not requesting it,\" said Reyes. \"We're demanding justice.\"\n\nline\nWho else spoke at the rally?\nSpeakers during the morning's programming included congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, who paid tribute to the activism of black Americans of the past whose \"sacrifice and self-determination shaped history and brought us to this moment\".\n\n\"We are Black with a capital B,\" she said. \"We are the manifestation of the movement. We are a symbol of social, political and cultural progress.\"\n\nOther presenters included a young activist who called for an end to the gun violence that plagues black communities, and representatives from unions, gay rights groups and Hispanic activism groups, who expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.Democratic vice-presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris addressed the rally virtually. Harris, who grew up in an activist household, paid tribute to civil rights leaders of the past. \"Let's March on for our ancestors and let's march on for our children and grandchildren,\" she said.\n\nAmong the initiatives on the agenda were slavery reparations, defunding police departments and investment in healthcare, housing and social services in black communities, organisers said. It was drafted by hundreds of delegates from across the country.",

Si tratta dell'infrastruttura CRESCO6, operativa presso il Centro ENEA di Portici, vicino Napoli, in grado di effettuare fino a 1,4 milioni di miliardi di operazioni matematiche al secondo. \"Crediamo che il supercomputer possa dare un contributo vitale in questo momento così cruciale per il nostro Paese per la ricerca di farmaci, vaccini e l'elaborazione di dati\", sottolinea il Presidente dell'ENEA Federico Testa. \"Ad oggi è già a disposizione del team di ricercatori dell'Università di Firenze, coordinato dal professor Piero Procacci, che sta lavorando a un processo per bloccare alla radice il meccanismo di replicazione del COVID-19 e, quindi, lo sviluppo del virus\", aggiunge Testa. HPC CRESCO6 - informa l'Enea - è la seconda infrastruttura di calcolo per ordine di importanza in ambito pubblico in Italia dopo quella di Cineca e sta svolgendo un ruolo chiave per testare l'efficacia dei composti sotto indagine, fornendo in poche ore una previsione affidabile della efficacia inibitoria di tali composti, basata su simulazioni a dettaglio atomistico effettuate su migliaia di processori in parallelo. In pochi giorni di test con il team del professor Procacci dell'Università di Firenze sono stati individuati almeno due composti con caratteristiche promettenti, uno dei quali disponibile commercialmente. Dopo questa prima fase di messa a punto strutturale dei composti ottenuti, HPC CRESCO6 verrà utilizzato per cercare di individuare la struttura molecolare ottimale per un possibile farmaco antivirale specifico per il COVID-19. Dal 2018, CRESCO6 figura nella prestigiosa TOP500, la classifica dei primi 500 supercomputer mondiali grazie al raddoppio della potenza arrivata a 1,4 milioni di miliardi di operazioni matematiche al secondo (1.4 PetaFlops). L'ingresso al 420° posto è stato annunciato al SuperComputing 2018 di Dallas, la principale conferenza nel campo del calcolo scientifico. Tra i campi di applicazione di CRESCO6: l'elaborazione di modelli previsionali su cambiamenti climatici e inquinamento dell'aria con dettaglio territoriale molto accurato; studio di nuovi materiali per la produzione di energia pulita; simulazioni per la gestione delle infrastrutture critiche; biotecnologie; chimica computazionale; fluidodinamica per il settore aerospaziale; sviluppo di codici per la fusione nucleare.

    "content": "ALBANY, N.Y. (September 5, 2019) - The New York State Department of Health today announced new findings of its ongoing investigation into the vaping-associated pulmonary (lung-related) illnesses that have been reported across the state, including an updated case count and information regarding the testing being conducted at the Department's Wadsworth Center Laboratory.\n\n\"The cases of pulmonary illnesses associated with vaping are continuing to rise across New York State and the country,\" said Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker. \"We urge the public to be vigilant about any vaping products that they or any family members may be using and to immediately contact their health care provider if they develop any unusual symptoms. In general, vaping of unknown substances is dangerous, and we continue to explore all options to combat this public health issue.\"\n\nThe Department issued a health advisory in August, alerting health care providers of this emerging health threat and listing symptoms they should look for in patients. As of September 5, 2019, the Department has received 34 reports from New York State physicians of severe pulmonary illness among patients ranging from 15 to 46 years of age who were using at least one cannabis-containing vape product before they became ill. However, all patients reported recent use of various vape products.\n\nLaboratory test results showed very high levels of vitamin E acetate in nearly all cannabis-containing samples analyzed by the Wadsworth Center as part of this investigation. At least one vitamin E acetate containing vape product has been linked to each patient who submitted a product for testing. Vitamin E acetate is not an approved additive for New York State Medical Marijuana Program-authorized vape products and was not seen in the nicotine-based products that were tested.\n\nAs a result, vitamin E acetate is now a key focus of the Department's investigation of potential causes of vaping-associated pulmonary illnesses. Vitamin E acetate is a commonly available nutritional supplement that is not known to cause harm when ingested as a vitamin supplement or applied to the skin. However, the Department continues to investigate its health effects when inhaled because its oil-like properties could be associated with the observed symptoms.\n\nThe Wadsworth Center is testing both cannabis and nicotine-containing vape products as part of this investigation and continues testing the purity of New York's approved medical marijuana products. More than a dozen product samples, in some cases multiple samples from a single product, from patients reporting symptoms have been tested. These samples have been tested for a range of substances, including THC and other cannabis-derived cannabinoids, nicotine, synthetic cannabinoids, opioids and pesticides. Products tested include a variety of labels and packaging. Many are suspected to be counterfeits of recreational cannabis-containing vape products available in other states.\n\nPictures of some of the products that have been found to contain vitamin E acetate can be seen here.\n\nAnyone using vape products should never use unregulated products purchased \"off the street.\" Cannabis-containing products are not legally available in New York State for recreational use. These unregulated products are not tested and may contain harmful substances. Users of vape products should never modify vape products or add any substances to these products that are not intended by the manufacturer.\n\nThe Department of Health advises people who are not certified patients in the New York State Medical Marijuana Program to consider not using any vape products. E-cigarettes are not an FDA-approved smoking cessation product. Most adult smokers want to quit, and individuals who smoke or use other tobacco products can improve their chances of quitting for good with treatment from their health care provider and by using FDA-approved medications.To learn more, talk to your health care provider, or call or visit the New York State Smokers' Quitline at 1-866-NYQUITS.\n\nAnyone experiencing symptoms who uses vape products should contact their healthcare provider immediately.Healthcare providers should report possible cases to the local poison control center (1-800-222-1222). Patients using vape products reported a variety of symptoms, developing over a period of days to weeks, including:\n\nPulmonary symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, chest pain)\nGastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)\nFatigue\nFever\nHeadache\nWeight loss",

    "content": "This year the Nobel Committee in Physics honored three “masters of light,” Charles Kao, Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith, whose work led to the invention of the cables that transmitted these words to your computer and the cameras that captured the image on your screen. Kao’s discoveries led to today’s widespread use of fiber optics, while Boyle and Smith invented the charge-coupled device, which is responsible for capturing light in digital cameras. The importance of these discoveries is obvious—can you imagine a world without high speed internet or the ability to instantaneously post pictures from last night’s party? But their significance was much less clear when they were made in the late 1960s.  In fact, according to The New York Times, Boyle and Smith initially wanted to construct novel electronic memory rather than an imaging device.\n\nBut wait—those of you intimately acquainted with Alfred Nobel’s will might wonder—how can the committee honor discoveries made in the ’60s that clearly violate Nobel’s criterion that awards should go “to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind”? This isn’t the first time a Nobel Prize has been bestowed for a discovery made much earlier than “the preceding year.” And it appears the time from initial discovery to its Nobel acknowledgment has generally increased since the first prize in 1901.\n\nSo why the discrepancy? As with this year’s honorees, it took some time for their discoveries’ “benefit on mankind” to be realized. Also, the committee may have wanted to avoid awkward controversies such as the one surrounding the 1938 award, in which Enrico Fermi was recognized for his 1934 “discovery” of transuranic elements, only to be disproved the following year. Best to give these conclusions a little time to be vetted to avoid eating crow.\n\nWhatever the reason, the spirit of Nobel’s intention has still remained intact, as it’s difficult to deny that this year’s winners have made a fundamental impact on our world.  But to all the physicists doing seminal work today—learn some patience. It might be a little while before you get your turn.",

    "content": "Earth is not necessarily the best planet in the universe. Researchers have identified two dozen planets outside our solar system that may have conditions more suitable for life than our own. Some of these orbit stars that may be better than even our sun.\n\nA study led by Washington State University scientist Dirk Schulze-Makuch recently published in the journal Astrobiology details characteristics of potential “superhabitable” planets, that include those that are older, a little larger, slightly warmer and possibly wetter than Earth. Life could also more easily thrive on planets that circle more slowly changing stars with longer lifespans than our sun.\n\nThe 24 top contenders for superhabitable planets are all more than 100 light years away, but Schulze-Makuch said the study could help focus future observation efforts, such as from NASA’s James Web Space Telescope, the LUVIOR space observatory and the European Space Agency’s PLATO space telescope.\n\n“With the next space telescopes coming up, we will get more information, so it is important to select some targets,” said Schulze-Makuch, a professor with WSU and the Technical University in Berlin. “We have to focus on certain planets that have the most promising conditions for complex life. However, we have to be careful to not get stuck looking for a second Earth because there could be planets that might be more suitable for life than ours.”For the study, Schulze-Makuch, a geobiologist with expertise in planetary habitability teamed up with astronomers Rene Heller of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and Edward Guinan of Villanova University to identify superhabitability criteria and search among the 4,500 known exoplanets beyond our solar system for good candidates. Habitability does not mean these planets definitely have life, merely the conditions that would be conducive to life.\n\nThe researchers selected planet-star systems with probable terrestrial planets orbiting within the host star’s liquid water habitable zone from the Kepler Object of Interest Exoplanet Archive of transiting exoplanets.\n\nWhile the sun is the center of our solar system, it has a relatively short lifespan of less than 10 billion years. Since it took nearly 4 billion years before any form of complex life appeared on Earth, many similar stars to our sun, called G stars, might run out of fuel before complex life can develop.\n\nIn addition to looking at systems with cooler G stars, the researchers also looked at systems with K dwarf stars, which are somewhat cooler, less massive and less luminous than our sun. K stars have the advantage of long lifespans of 20 billion to 70 billion years. This would allow orbiting planets to be older as well as giving life more time to advance to the complexity currently found on Earth. However, to be habitable, planets should not be so old that they have exhausted their geothermal heat and lack protective geomagnetic fields. Earth is around 4.5 billion years old, but the researchers argue that the sweet spot for life is a planet that is between 5 billion to 8 billion years old.\n\nSize and mass also matter. A planet that is 10% larger than the Earth should have more habitable land. One that is about 1.5 times Earth’s mass would be expected to retain its interior heating through radioactive decay longer and would also have a stronger gravity to retain an atmosphere over a longer time period.\n\nWater is key to life and the authors argue that a little more of it would help, especially in the form of moisture, clouds and humidity. A slightly overall warmer temperature, a mean surface temperature of about 5 degrees Celsius (or about 8 degrees Fahrenheit) greater than Earth, together with the additional moisture, would be also better for life. This warmth and moisture preference is seen on Earth with the greater biodiversity in tropical rain forests than in colder, drier areas.\n\nAmong the 24 top planet candidates none of them meet all the criteria for superhabitable planets, but one has four of the critical characteristics, making it possibly much more comfortable for life than our home planet.\n\n“It’s sometimes difficult to convey this principle of superhabitable planets because we think we have the best planet,” said Schulze-Makuch. “We have a great number of complex and diverse lifeforms, and many that can survive in extreme environments. It is good to have adaptable life, but that doesn’t mean that we have the best of everything.”\n\nReference: “In Search for a Planet Better than Earth: Top Contenders for a Superhabitable World” by Dirk Schulze-Makuch, René Heller and Edward Guinan, 18 September 2020, Astrobiology.\nDOI: 10.1089/ast.2019.2161",

The unusual deal shows Ottawa’s determination to scale up testing, a key step towards relaxing strict public health measures that have disrupted daily life and tanked economies around the world.\n\nIn March, Canada passed emergency legislation that gave the government and third parties it designates the right to produce patented goods without the patent holders’ consent. Doing that could have been technically difficult, without a company’s formula.\n\nWhile there is no indication that Canada forced Biomerieux to agree to the license, the option was available.\n\nBiomérieux did not respond to questions about whether it had made similar arrangements with any other governments, or the revenue impact of the agreement.\n\nIt reported a 21.5% increase in sales in the first quarter, thanks in part to demand for reagent. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) described the arrangement as a temporary license that allows the government to manufacture Biomérieux products used for coronavirus testing. It did not say whether it threatened to use the new law, and said the license was signed “at no cost.”\n\nPHAC said its manufacturing was still in “development and testing” and its goal was to alleviate shortages soon.\n\nIn its email to customers in early April, Biomérieux’s Canadian unit said the move was meant to clear up testing backlogs, an indication of the stress in the supply chain that makes testing possible. The company said it was also boosting its own production.\n\nThe chemicals in short supply, also called reagents, are used to extract RNA, the virus’s genetic material, from patient samples. A handful of companies make most RNA extraction equipment and sell reagent kits made for their own machines, a bit like inkjet printer cartridges.\n\nOther major suppliers are Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.N acquisition target Qiagen and Roche ROG.S. All are facing soaring demand, as public health workers around the world race to find people who could be spreading the virus. “We hope that in the near future, this move will allow federal and provincial labs to test more Canadians, thus reducing testing backlogs,” Biomerieux said in its customer note.\n\n“This private-public collaboration signals that unprecedented times, require unprecedented solutions.” Biomérieux extraction equipment is widely used in Canada.\n\nIts machines were the primary system used by Ontario’s public health labs, and heavy reliance on one brand contributed to a testing slowdown in late March. Biomérieux equipment is also widely used in Quebec, according to the provincial government.\n\nPHAC said the deal is an “interim solution”, because its facilities are not meant to be used for long-term manufacturing.\n\nOn Thursday, Canada pledged C$1.1 billion ($782 million) for research and drug or vaccine manufacturing in its fight against the coronavirus.",

    "content": "US sanctions directed at Venezuela target President Nicolás Maduro and his circle of elite government officials in an attempt to control their access to financial assistance from US citizens and companies. In 2015, The Obama administration issued sanctions against Maduro’s administration on the grounds of human rights violations, and they continue under current US President Donald Trump to this day. \n\nOn Monday, the US government imposed fresh sanctions against Venezuela's national oil firm, Petroleos De Venezuela SA — PDVSA. The penalties aim to freeze exchanges and block imports. \n\nVenezuela’s power crisis exploded on Jan. 23 when opposition leader Juan Guaidó invoked a constitutional right to take presidential powers and call for new elections. Maduro’s 2018 election victory was deemed illegitimate by numerous nations in Latin America, Europe as well as Canada, who recognize Guaidó’s legitimacy instead. The international community rushed to take sides, some calling Guaidó’s move a coup while others referred to it as a “self-declaration.” The current power crisis in Venezuela has raised new, complicated questions on the role and impact of US sanctions. \n\nSanctions against PDVSA are likely to yield stronger and more direct economic consequences, given Venezuela’s dependency on oil exports and the importance of diluent imports from the US used to process the country’s heavy crude oil. PDVSA and its US subsidiary, Citgo, has been described as Maduro's \"lifeline\" — Venezuela exported more than 1 million barrels per day to the US in 2018, a significant drop from last year, according to Refinitiv via Reuters.On Monday, Guaidó asked congress to appoint new board members to PDVSA — just before the US issued fresh sanctions. \n\nThe US is now redirecting PDVSA payments directly to Guaidó as interim president and US national security adviser John Bolton said sanctions would block $7 billion in PDVSA’s assets “plus over $11 billion in lost export proceeds over the next year,” according to Reuters. \n\nDavid Smolansky, former mayor of El Hatillo metropolitan district in Caracas and member of opposition party Voluntad Popular, sees the sanctions as an effective way to pressure Maduro’s government. \n\n“Many of these high officials have fortunes in foreign banks and properties in foreign countries,” Smolansky says. “The sanctions have debilitated their possibility to move around internationally as well as their financial possibilities abroad. These sanctions have not hurt Venezuelans, they are individual sanctions coming from multilateral efforts of not only the United States, but also Canada, the European Union, and other Latin American countries.”\n\nWhile “Chavismo” (socialist) elites were hit with a variety of sanctions over the last three years, they’ve done little to make an impact on ordinary Venezuelans, whose lives have spiraled into a humanitarian crisis as hyperinflation has driven nearly 3 million to flee. \n\n“The sanctions have nothing to do with hyperinflation (projected to reach a 10 million percent this year), with the fall in oil production, or the food and medicine shortage that has generated a humanitarian and a migrant crisis. The only person responsible for that is Nicolás Maduro,” Smolansky adds.  \n\nRelated: How Venezuela’s oil sector is coping with US sanctionsRafael Uzcátegui, director of local human rights organization Provea, laments the use of sanctions, however — particularly the most recent ones. Uzcátegui believes the sanctions will indeed have an important effect on Venezuelans’ everyday lives. \n\n“The situation will deteriorate with these last sanctions especially, they could limit any transaction that Maduro’s government could make to import food and medicine,” Uzcátegui says. “We should remember that 70 to 80 percent of Venezuela’s food is imported, and there’s barely any medicine production in the country.”\n\nUzcátegui, too, holds Maduro and his government responsible. \n\n“They have refused to recognize the severity of [the] crisis and have insisted in a series of public policies and decisions that have exacerbated the levels of poverty,” he says. “Moreover, they have promoted the usurpation of the presidential power after an electoral fraud, which is the origin of the current political crisis.” Blockade, sanction or embargo? \nFor Pedro José Garcia Sanchez, a researcher specializing in populism and authoritarianism at the University of West Paris-Nanterre, a sort of fusion of terms tends to happen, confusing economic blockade, sanctions and embargo. \n\n“The sanctions target specific government officials, not the whole country,” Sanchez explains, which goes against the more simplistic ideological narrative that pits socialism against US imperialism circulated often in academia and the media. \n\nAn embargo bans exchange and trade whereas blockades prevent goods from entering countries, and economic sanctions are a far wider concept, defined by the threat of withdrawal or restrictions on financial relations. America’s global banking system is extensive and sanctions alone could prevent Venezuelan government officials from carrying out financial transactions or issuing new debt through US banks, says David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). US sanctions imposed in 2017 attempted to prevent government officials from securing financial relief as living conditions continued to worsen.  Venezuela’s political crisis reached new heights of tension in 2017 when the Supreme Court of Justice effectively nullified the opposition-led National Assembly. The move was met with protests that lasted for months, and in which violent crackdowns left behind over 160 deaths, according to the Venezuelan Observatory of Conflict.   \n\nIn response, the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Venezuela, and Maduro accused the US of plunging Venezuelan citizens further into economic crisis. \n\n“The idea behind this [2017] sanction is very specific, and it intends to limit the capacity of Maduro’s selling all of Venezuela’s assets,”Smilde says.\n\nHowever, by the time those sanctions were implemented, Smilde explained, the legitimacy of Maduro’s government was already diminished. US sanctions became part of a larger and more complicated process of mitigating debt in Venezuela.  \n\nBy law, Maduro must seek approval through the opposition-led National Assembly to borrow funds to deal with skyrocketing debt. But since 2017, Maduro has refused to recognize its authority, bypassing due process as a borrower. \n\n“What can be said is that government could get around the sanctions if they recognize the National Assembly and pass debt through them — as it is stated in the Constitution,” Smilde added.By 2018, the US list of government officials sanctions expanded, including First Lady Cilia Flores and Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who had previously described the sanctions as “arbitrary and unlawful.” Other public pro-government figures claim these financial limitations have harmed Venezuelans directly, but the direct impact has been unclear. \n\n“The official goal in 2015 was to punish government officials who were either corrupted or had committed human rights violations, as well as to deter other officials who would be willing to do the same,” says Smilde. \n\nHe says economic sanctions tend to have little palpable effects but are the best non-violent way to express disagreement toward a government. Humanitarian crisis continues\nMeanwhile, Venezuela’s complex humanitarian crisis continues to expand. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that, as of November 2018, more than 3 million of an estimated 32 million Venezuelans had fled their country since 2014. At the same time, the Venezuelan Observatory of Health highlighted that 94 percent of Venezuelans don’t have enough revenue to pay for basic supplies — especially food. \n\nCensorship and control of information online, as well as mainstream media, has grown stronger and expansive in the last years. Venezuelan prisons and intelligence services offices hold more than 230 political prisoners and have arrested more than 12,500 people since 2014 in connection with protests, including underage minors, according to the Foro Penal, a Venezuelan network of pro-bono criminal defense lawyers. \n\nFor years, human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch have denounced the police and armed forces for abuses, saying that “in some cases amount to torture — including severe beatings, electric shocks, asphyxiation and sexual abuse.”\n\nA 2019 report by Provea, a human rights group, estimates 250 people have been killed in protests during the Maduro era. And these numbers continue to soar, according to Provea. As heated debates around intervention and foreign powers continue to fuel exchanges inside and outside Venezuela, everyday Venezuelans continue to brave harsh realities. \n\nOn Jan. 30, thousands marched in Caracas on Jan. 30, calling for the end of Maduro, and power in Venezuela remains uncertain. The latest sanctions halt all US oil purchases in an attempt to put an end to what the US says is Maduro’s history of plundering PDVSA profits to private accounts, ultimately wanting to support Guiadó and push Maduro out of power. \n\nA cautious hope grips Venezuela, but given the grim history of US interventions in Latin America, some fear a turn for the worse. The ones who pay — regardless of who intervenes — are the Venezuelan people.",

However, the FBI and CISA have no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised.\"U.S. officials said separately that systems in two local government jurisdictions had been accessed, granting attackers admission to some limited data about voters. But they were also adamant that the attackers were not in a position to actually affect results.\n\n\"We're not aware of any activity that would put them in a position to come anywhere near a vote,\" said Chris Krebs, the director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nAt a briefing Thursday afternoon, Krebs said he saw the announcement as more of a broad cybersecurity statement rather than one specifically focused on election security, since the attacker's intentions were not clear based on the broad number of agencies and organizations targeted.Cyber attackers are \"opportunistic,\" Krebs said, and in this case they were able to use vulnerabilities in the fairly simplistic county government infrastructures to move within a number of offices inside a single government. In at least one of the cases, that led them to some publicly available voting data.\n\n\"We don't have any reason to believe they were looking for election infrastructure or election-related information,\" Krebs said. \"They just found themselves there.\"\n\nGovernment officials do not usually announce the location of hacks, but The Washington Post reported Thursday that the counties breached are in California and Indiana.\n\nKrebs added that it's possible, if not probable, that the group has breached more governments, but they haven't been discovered yet.\n\n\"I'm paranoid by nature, so I assume we'll find at some point some additional compromises,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement came one day after an in-person briefing by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and FBI Director Christopher Wray in which they warned about Russian interference as well as an Iranian scheme to intimidate voters with spoof emails.\n\nThe agencies involved have been warning for months, including with similar bulletins about cyber risks confronting U.S. elections infrastructure, which they have suggested likely would focus on systems adjacent to core operations — such as a website that shows results — as opposed to the casting and counting of ballots themselves.Ratcliffe, Wray and others have warned about the prospect that influence-mongers could exploit the headlines about cyberattacks, and some potential real exploits, to make claims about compromised election systems that might not be legitimate.\n\n\"We've been working for years as a community to build resilience in our election infrastructure — and today that infrastructure remains resilient,\" Wray said Wednesday. \"You should be confident that your vote counts. Early, unverified claims to the contrary should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism.\"The bulletin Thursday alluded to the prospect that the network activity detected by U.S. authorities could enable attackers to access sensitive systems, including even by printing access badges.\n\nAnd though American authorities said they've detected no disruptions, \"the [attackers] may be seeking access to obtain future disruption options, to influence U.S. policies and actions, or to delegitimize ... government entities.\"\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how or whether the U.S. might respond to the Russian cyberattacks discussed Thursday afternoon, but earlier in the day the Treasury Department announced it has sanctioned a number of Iranian government entities in connection with what U.S. officials called their interference in the election.",

    "content": "Naval battle lines are being drawn up ahead of talks between the European Union and UK, with fisheries among the most difficult and high profile topics where the two sides diverge\nThis week has seen negotiating mandates set out - with one side wanting little change and the other side wanting a radical re-drawing of 40 years of managing the industry. Brussels' muscle is the threat of closing off access to markets\nWhile much of the attention is on the interests of larger boats, the concerns of the inshore fleet are different. Along with fish processors, they want to ensure they can still sell, easily and without tariffs, to France and Spain\nFish have been served up among the main bones of contention between the UK government and the European Union.\n\nThe negotiating mandate published on Thursday at Westminster is a long way from the vision for a future relationship for managing wild fish stocks in the European Commission's proposals.\n\nThat comes as no surprise to those who have seen the pre-negotiation posturing - from the rhetoric of the 2016 Brexit campaign, to the priorities set out by Brussels along with the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nThe industry does not matter nearly as much as car manufacturing or finance. In employment terms, traditional fishing represents less than 1% of the UK economy, and little more than that in Scotland.\n\nHowever, it is of totemic importance to coastal communities and to the governments that represent them. Brexiteers played on dislike of the Common Fisheries Policy, making claims of the harm it did since 1973.\n\nIn negotiations to join, one telling Whitehall internal discussion saw fisheries described as \"expendable\" alongside other priorities. That treatment has been a powerful way of boosting hostility to the EU from Shetland and north-east Scotland to Cornwall.\n\nHowever, other parts of the fishing industry are concerned that their access to European markets will suffer in the looming negotiations, including creel fishing and food processing.\n\nOn Wednesday in the Scottish Parliament, Fergus Ewing, the cabinet secretary responsible for fisheries (and much else besides), set out means of getting the inshore fleet to get along better, resolving disputes over gear and putting less plastic in the water. He also set out how significant that sector is:\n\n80% of Scotland's 2,000 registered fishing vessels operate in inshore waters\nOf those 1,600 boats, most are micro-businesses going after prawns, langoustine, lobster and scallops\nMuch of the catch is heading for export markets in France, Spain and Italy: in 2018, £100m-worth of langoustines were exported from the UK\nTwo-thirds of the world's langoustines are sourced in Scotland, he said, mostly destined for France, Spain and Italy\nMuch of that catch is trucked, fresh or even live, to continental markets. The sector fears health certificates will be required, adding to delay and cost. And trucks could be stuck in bottlenecks at Channel ports, each one with diminishing value to its cargo as it does so.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain, France and the continuing EU members around the North Sea have ensured the industry has a special status in the EU negotiating mandate. Even though many other countries have no coast let alone a fishing fleet, they have signed up to this.\n\nSo this week, the two sides crystallised their positions. On Tuesday, Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, put fisheries in the context of the free trade deal he wants to secure.\n\nThe mandate emphasises the scarcity of fish and the need to manage stocks responsibly, and the sharing of data and research. On that, there's no disagreement - though both sides saying they'll look to scientific advice overlooks the track record of the Common Fisheries Policy. It routinely bends its way round that advice for reasons of political expediency and governments rarely complain about that.\n\nThe EU then wants \"to uphold existing reciprocal access conditions, quota shares and the traditional activity of the EU fleet\". Note that includes the lesser amount of catch by UK boats from neighbouring countries' waters.\n\nMonsieur Barnier proposes that quota shares should only be adjustable with the consent of both the UK and EU. He wants a long-term management deal, with transfers and exchanges of quotas. The EU side wants joint control and inspection to ensure equality of treatment and compliance between different fleets.\n\nIn short, Brussels and its member states want to see very little change, and no unilateral UK right to vary from the status quo. And the leverage? \"The terms on access shall guide the conditions set out in other aspects of the economic part of the envisaged partnership\". That is: access to EU markets.\n\nWhere both sides are agreed again is on the pressure to get a deal by this summer, so that a new system for negotiating annual catch quotas can be in place in plenty time for the traditional pre-Christmas middle-of-the-night deal.\n\nIf there's no such deal, the UK can dust down plans it drew up last year for a sharp and expensive increase in patrol boats and aircraft to keep out all EU fishers.\n\n'Relative stability'\nAnd what does the UK government want? The first obstacle to a deal is that it puts fisheries at the top of a section in the negotiating mandate, called \"Other Agreements\". Along with aviation, the Whitehall intention is to separate fish catch in UK waters from fish sales in EU markets: \"Trade in fisheries products should be covered by the Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement\".\n\nIn place of long term management, the British proposal is for annual negotiations, similar to those with Norway. And Britain would, from 2021 onwards, negotiate a share-out of northern North Sea quotas directly with Norway.\n\nThere's a rejection of \"relative stability\" - the Common Fisheries Policy jargon for maintaining national shares on the historic basis as they stood in the 1970s. Following the approach taken to the share-out with Norway, the British will talk of \"zonal attachment\". This is about allowing fishers to follow where the fish live, acknowledging that shoals don't recognise sea boundaries.\n\nEU boats licensed to fish in UK waters would have to comply with UK rules. \"The UK is open to providing for the creation of a forum for co-operation on wider fisheries matters... such as data-sharing, science, control and enforcement\". There would be an agreed mid-way of settling disputes, and a right to suspend the licensing agreement.\n\nAn important added sentence for Holyrood consumption: \"The UK government recognises the interests of the devolved administrations in this area, and is committed to working with them in the consideration of any agreement.\"\n\nThat wording is a long way from willingness to compromise with diverging Scottish government priorities, even though Scotland has most of the UK catching fleet.\n\nSo this week we got the starting points, with room for some agreement, but far more potential for fisheries to be a source of tension through the talks on the future and long-term relationship.\n\nHow can the two positions be reconciled? By one side giving ground, of course. That might be achieved by a method often used in negotiations that involve the European Union - phasing in change over enough time that it softens the blow of unwelcome change.",

    "content": "YouTube on Wednesday said it's removing videos that push extremist views like white supremacy or deny events like the Holocaust or Sandy Hook shooting. The new policy is an attempt to crack down on hate speech on the Google-owned video service.\n\nThe new rules prohibit any video \"alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.\"\n\nYouTube didn't specifically say which channels or videos it's removing. The company has drawn criticism for how it enforces its policies and its decision-making process when it comes to leaving up videos that some deem hateful.\n\nThe update follows a controversy Tuesday evening, when YouTube refused to take down the channel of a prominent conservative personality named Stephen Crowder for using homophobic slurs against journalist Carlos Maza, a writer and video host at Vox. Maza, who is gay, created a supercut of Crowder calling him a \"lispy sprite\" and \"little queer.\"\n\nYouTube said Crowder's videos didn't violate the site's rules. \"Our teams spent the last few days conducting an in-depth review of the videos flagged to us, and while we found language that was clearly hurtful, the videos as posted don't violate our policies,\" the company said in a series of tweets Tuesday night. \"Opinions can be deeply offensive, but if they don't violate our policies, they'll remain on our site.\"YouTube also said Wednesday it would remove channels that \"brush up\" against its hate speech rules -- but don't necessarily break them -- from its YouTube Partner Program, which lets creators run ads on their channel and use other monetization features. For other \"borderline\" content, YouTube said it would reduce the reach of the video and surround it by more authoritative content, like putting a video on the topic from a trusted news source in the \"Watch next\" panel.\n\nYouTube hasn't banned Crowder's channel, but later Wednesday said it would suspend its monetization. \n\n\"We came to this decision because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies,\" the company tweeted. However, the company said in a follow-up tweet that Crowder would be able to monetize his channel again if he addressed certain issues, including removing a link from the video selling his T-shirts and merchandise. \n\nYouTube didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about what else would need to be fixed. \n\nThe new hate speech policy also comes as platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter face intense scrutiny for their ability to police the content on their platforms. Facebook in March announced it was banning white nationalist and separatist content. But it has also faced blowback for its decision to leave up a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that had been doctored to make her appear drunk. (YouTube decided the video was inappropriate and removed it from its service.)\n\nYouTube also said it has partnered with lawmakers and other organizations to help combat the spread of extremism on its service. On Wednesday, one of those partners, the Anti-Defamation League, applauded the new policy by YouTube but called on the company to do more. \n\n\"We were glad to share our expertise on this and look forward to continuing to provide input,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL's CEO and national director, said in a statement. \"While this is an important step forward, this move alone is insufficient and must be followed by many more changes from YouTube and other tech companies to adequately counter the scourge of online hate and extremism.\"Originally published June 5, 9:54 a.m. PT.\nUpdate, 12:03 p.m. PT: Adds news that YouTube suspended monetization of Crowder's channel; 1 p.m. PT and 2:06 p.m. PT: Adds YouTube's followup statements about Crowder's demonetization.",

    "content": "During the early morning hours on Feb. 1, the Nigerian terror group Boko Haram launched its second attack on the city of Maiduguri.\nThe Islamist group has kept Maiduguri in its sights for a long time. It’s the capital of Nigeria’s northeast and home to a population exceeding two million people, and has a garrison of several thousand Nigerian troops and a major air force base.\nNigerian troops beat back the attackers and claimed to inflict hundreds of casualties. But Maiduguri wasn’t the only battle the insurgents fought in recent weeks. They took the town of Baga, plus 16 surrounding villages at the beginning of the year, after battling the local garrison for several hours.\nAnd after the first foiled attack on Maiduguri last week, Boko Haram stillmanaged to capture another town, Monguno, defended by an army contingent of equal size.\nWhile official casualty counts from the Nigerian army are often exaggerated, the group’s repeated attacks raise the question—how many freaking militants does Boko Haram actually have?Reliable estimates of Boko Haram’s strength do not exist. The group tolerates no independent reporting from the areas it controls, and military accounts are equally inaccurate and unreliable.\nLocal and international experts put the number at anywhere between 5,000 and 50,000 active fighters. This latter figure is almost certainly far too big.\nBut it’s possible to infer a rough estimate of Boko Haram’s size, which helps understand both the group’s actions—and its weaknesses. And one of the easiest ways to estimate the Islamists’ strength is to compare them with other, similar groups.\n By now, Boko Haram has without a doubt transformed itself from a simple terrorist organization into a territorial insurgency comparable to Al Shabaab in Somalia, and the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, although there are important differences between all three.\nAt the height of its power in September 2014, Islamic State had an estimated 31,500 fighters. U.S.-led airstrikes and Kurdish offensives have since killed thousands, although the group has surely recruited to offset these losses.\nA rough estimate would put the strength of Islamic State at currently 25,000 troops, who defend a huge territory—including several major towns—against comparatively stronger conventional armies and international air power.In Somalia, Al Shabaab has lost some of its strength, but the Islamist group still fields about 5,000 well-trained, experienced and equipped militants, according to the most recent estimates. This force is large enough to hold onto 55,000 square kilometers—a region the size of Croatia—against more than 21,000 African Union peacekeepers and several thousand local militiamen and government forces.\nBy comparison, Boko Haram currently controls an area the size of Belgium, about half the territory of Al Shabaab.\nBoko Haram’s fighters are by all accounts neither as experienced nor as well-trained as Al Shabaab or Islamic State. But its opponents—up until the entry of Chad into the conflict—are weaker.\nFrom these comparisons, we can deduce with moderate certainty that Boko Haram has a core strength of 7,000 to 10,000 fighters.\nThere’s several reasons for this. One is that 7,000 to 10,000 troops fits the tactical profile of the group. Boko Haram can muster the strength to defeat several dozen to several hundred enemy soldiers, but falters in the face of strong resistance by several thousand troops—like in Maiduguri.\nOf course, Boko Haram’s core strength can’t easily compensate for the heavy losses taken during the last few months. This means Boko Haram probably has an additional reserve of several thousand novice recruits and slave soldiers.\n\nBoko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in May 2014. Photo from Boko Haram propaganda video\nSure enough, there are reports of both ramped-up recruitment among youths in neighboring countries—and further abductions of men and boys who the terror group forces into service. The number of these auxiliaries is harder to discern, but it’s probably in the range of an extra 10,000 men.\nBoko Haram likely uses these press-ganged soldiers as expendable cannon fodder. They’re placed in the most exposed positions during an attack, and consequently take the most losses.\nThe figure of a 7,000 to 10,000-strong core force also fits with what Boko Haram cannot do.\nConsiderably more than 10,000 well-equipped and experienced men—like Islamic State—would have by now taken Maiduguri. The city is comparable in size to Mosul and clearly an important goal for Boko Haram.\nBut considerably fewer than 7,000 men couldn’t likely control such a large swath of territory, and still mount offensive operations against fortified enemy positions in Baga and Monguno—or carry out frequent cross-border raids into Cameroon.\nTaking these numbers into account, we can make some predictions about the further development of the conflict. Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad have deployed about 35,000 troops against Boko Haram—a considerable numerical advantage.\nIf the well-trained and equipped Chadians operate in Nigerian territory—and have sufficient air support—a concerted effort might be able to block further Boko Haram advances.\nBut the example of Somalia shows that numbers aren’t everything.\nInsurgencies count on rough terrain and support from the local population to survive. Boko Haram has both. And Al Shabaab has held out for years despite similar disadvantages.\n\nThen there’s everything we don’t know about Boko Haram.\nThe group’s financial and organizational capabilities are even more opaque than its military. Both Islamic State and Al Shabaab have substantial income from well-established economic activities, and both rely heavily on civil administrations to extract resources from the local population.\nLittle is known about the capabilities of Boko Haram in this regard.\n\n\n\n\n\nSure enough, there are reports of both ramped-up recruitment among youths in neighboring countries—and further abductions of men and boys who the terror group forces into service.

    "content": "For the past three years, Alicia Soto has traveled back to the city where her life was changed forever.\n\nThe emotional scars from the Route 91 Harvest music festival mass shooting have not fully healed, but Soto said that attending the 1 October Sunrise Remembrance Ceremony every year has helped her process her trauma. On Thursday, the 42-year-old was one of about 200 people wearing face masks and standing 6 feet apart in the Clark County Government Center’s outdoor amphitheater for the ceremony.\n\n“That night I lost a part of me, and I come back looking for it,” Soto said, with tears in her eyes.\n\nSince October 2017, Soto has moved from California to Minneapolis and has started her dream job as a flight attendant. She said that she decided to “live life to the fullest” for those who died in the attack.\n\nA slideshow during the ceremony displayed the names and pictures of the 58 people killed that night. The pictures of two women who died within the past year of injuries they suffered in the mass shooting were included at the end with a message reading, “In Memoriam of 1 October Victims Lost in the Last Year.”At the end of the ceremony, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced that the two women, Kimberly Gervais of Mira Loma, California, and Samanta Arjune of Las Vegas, will be added to the official death toll, raising the number from 58 to 60.\n\nThe announcement came after the Review-Journal on Monday published an article that highlighted their deaths and reported the Metropolitan Police Department’s initial decision not to include them in the death total.“It isn’t like we’re trying to avoid the names,” Lombardo said in a brief interview after the ceremony. He later added that, “At this point, I think I’m comfortable in acknowledging that the other two individuals lost their lives as a result of 1 October.”\n\nThere were fewer people at the ceremony this year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced officials to limit the number of people who could attend. Gov. Steve Sisolak, who also addressed the crowd, said that when he raised the limit on public gatherings this week, Thursday’s event was one of his “biggest priorities.”Sisolak’s voice grew shaky as he recalled that night and offered his condolences to the family members of those who died.\n\n“We will never, never forget what happened that day, or the lives that were lost, and the lives that were changed,” he said.\n\nAlbert Rivera, the father of Jordyn Rivera, who was 21 when she was killed in the attack, said he was thankful to all the survivors who continue to come together on the anniversary and support each other.\n\n“We are all a statistic — we are all part of this unwanted fraternity we didn’t chose to be a part of,” he said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged Greg Zanis, an Illinois carpenter who built 58 crosses honoring those who died in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Zanis died in May of terminal bladder cancer, and Rivera said he will “be forever changed” by Zanis’ kindness.\n\nHe ended his remarks by calling for unity during what he said has been a time of divisiveness in the U.S. He urged people to remember how they came together on Oct. 2, 2017.\n\n“It’s said that it takes more effort to hate than to love. Let’s remember that,” he said. “Until we meet again — here, there or in the air — may we all smile like Jordyn.”",

    "content": "The social uprising in Chile has now reached its fourth month. Masses of people continue to protest and demand structural change despite ferocious repression—mainly at the hands of the militarized Carabineros police force—which has revived traumatic memories. Now, Chileans are looking ahead to a plebiscite that may open the way to a new Constitution. The dictatorship-era charter has been a major obstacle to change over the past three decades. Redrafting the constitution is a key demand in Chileans’ sweeping rebuke of the status quo.  \n\nGeneral Augusto Pinochet’s 1980 Constitution both symbolizes and imposes the authoritarian model at the root of the ongoing mobilization. The Constitution institutionalized the economic and political domination of the dictatorship and enshrined a neoliberal framework that erased the role of the state in social and economic areas. It restricted political participation, gave the Right disproportionate power, and installed a tutelary role for the armed forces. And it continues to straightjacket the Chilean system. I, among others, analyzed such regimes in the 1990s—I termed them “guardian systems.”\n\nDespite 30 years of post-dictatorship elected rule and some reforms to the 1980 Constitution, the market model embodied in Pinochet’s charter still shapes economics and politics in the country. Pinochet’s radical neoliberal transformation privatized the pension system and promoted the development of a private sector in the health and education fields. These privatizations have perpetuated inequality and reinforced extreme social divisions. Moreover, Chile is the only country in the world with almost completely privatized water—Chapter III, Clause 24 of the 1980 Constitution establishes the “right” to private ownership of water. Drought paired with the corporate monopolization of water resources concessioned to the mining and agriculture industries have caused multiple communities, small farms, and cities in various parts of the country to run dry in the past year. The Constitution locked in these “guardian structures” by imposing strict rules for constitutional amendments, requiring supermajorities in Congress.\n\nChile’s elected governments have not reformed or democratized the Carabineros since the dictatorship, and the militarized police continue to treat the Chilean people as “the internal enemy.” Shortly after the protests began in October, president Sebastián Piñera, a right-wing billionaire, declared while surrounded by military officers: “We are at war.” He called thousands of army troops to patrol the streets for the first time since the dictatorship, to enforce a 10-day curfew, evoking memories of Pinochet’s terror. Piñera’s government, whose support has vacillated between 4 to 7 percent in 2020, has used repression to sow fear, intimidate, and attempt to divide protesters. But outrage over the October crackdown only spurred more massive demonstrations. On October 25, 1.2 million chilenos gathered to protest in Santiago’s Plaza Italia. “¡Chile despertó!” they chanted. “Chile woke up.”\n\nSince then, several international human rights delegations have criticized the security forces, denouncing the deliberate intent to inflict harm on the protesters rather than disperse them. In November 2019, Human Rights Watch noted “compelling evidence of excessive use of force and abuses against demonstrators and bystanders.” Chileans are struggling against the repression of the state as well as the unjust economic system. They are demanding rights for the people as opposed to private profit-making.\n\nInequality in Chile\n\nThe October protests put Chile’s entrenched inequality in the spotlight. A 2019 study by The Lancet showed that a woman in a poor district of Santiago lives some 18 years less than a woman in a rich neighborhood in the same city. Chile’s income inequality gap is more than 65 percent wider than the OECD average, and it has one of the highest ratios between the average income of the wealthiest and poorest 10 percent of the population, according to a 2018 report. The neoliberal gutting of public services has fueled rampant inequality. The country has two health systems: an excellent private system for those who can pay First World fees, and a severely underfunded public system serving some 80 percent of Chileans. Wait times in public hospitals can last for years and there are insufficient supplies. Almost 10,000 persons died in the first half of 2018 while waiting for an operation or treatment in the public system.\n\nThe privatized pension system, which has produced a bonanza of wealth for its investors, pays a pittance to elderly people who worked their whole lives. According to a 2015 report by La Comisión Asesora Presidencial sobre el Sistema de Pensiones, 80 percent of retirees receive less than the minimum wage of $414 per month in pensions. The educational system reproduces class divisions, as youths from the upper classes easily enter prestigious universities, while those from modest backgrounds come from substandard schools. University education—considered a market commodity and not a right or a public good—is expensive, and families go into debt for years to pay. Salaries are low and the cost of living continues to increase. The metro fare hike that sparked the social uprising in October was the last straw. As the protesters chanted, “It’s not 30 pesos, it’s 30 years!”\n\nChile’s Social Rebellion\n\nWhile continuing Chile’s rich history of popular resistance, the demonstrations since October also mark a new era of social struggle defined by broad-based participation, youth involvement, and new forms and symbols of autonomous mobilization. “María,” (not her real name), who has attended all the Friday protests as well as others, explained that since October, the Carabineros, with their tanks and squadrons, have blocked the avenues where people have traditionally marched. María, a young professional and social science graduate, pointed out that that the strategy produces large concentrations of people in the plazas. The primera linea—youths who wear bandanas and carry homemade shields—ring the crowd to protect them from bullets, gas canisters, and advances by the Carabineros. Meanwhile, popular symbols have changed. In large demonstrations in the past, people carried the banners of their political parties or social organizations. Such banners are gone in the protests today, reflecting the spontaneous nature of the social explosion and its distance from the political parties. Today people carry Chilean flags, Mapuche flags, or black flags condemning state violence. More surprising are the banners denoting allegiance to particular fútbol teams, such as Colo-Colo, which is something new. The protests grow in size whenever there is a new outrage.Chileans are demanding an end to socioeconomic and political exclusion. Some 70 to 80 percent are in favor of a new Constitution—forged under democracy—to guarantee social rights. Chileans now look forward to the national plebiscite called for April 26 to vote for a path toward a Constitution that will protect the rights to education, health, and decent pensions, among others. The Piñera government initially resisted the idea of a plebiscite, but reluctantly acquiesced after political parties in Congress signed an agreement in November 2019 to move toward a solution to the massive unrest.\n\nThe plebiscite will ask voters two questions: whether or not they want a new Constitution, and whether they want the constitutional convention that would draft it to be made up of citizens or a mixed body of citizens and legislators. The convention would draft a new Constitution to be ratified in another national plebiscite.\n\nThe constituent process had to be approved by Congress and parliamentarians have a key role in legislating the mechanisms needed for the constitutional process. The Left has pushed for the constituent convention to have gender parity and to reserve seats for independent social activists, not only political party members, as well as Mapuche representatives, but these measures have not yet succeeded in Congress. In the Senate, 3/5 approval was necessary to approve gender parity; although outvoted, the right-wing minority had enough votes in January to block the measure. The extreme Right is already lobbying against the new Constitution. In particular, members of the Unión Demócrata Independiente (UDI), founded by Pinochet functionaries, prefer authoritarian options to preserve their wealth and power. Some sectors of the extreme Right want to annul the plebiscite entirely, arguing that there is too much violence for the process to take place.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has made its position clear. On December 16, when a television journalist asked whether he would contemplate a new model as people were demanding, Piñera— a key proponent of Trump’s campaign to oust Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro—retorted: “If you speak of a change in the model you’re thinking of Venezuela!” On February 2, the minister of education, Marcela Cubillos, declared that she was not “neutral” on the constitutional process, stating that “the government represents a project of society whose fundamental values are expressed in the current Constitution.” Cubillos, a UDI member, is known for her repressive reactions to protests, her intransigence, and her hostile attitude toward educational reform. Her father was a navy officer, an organizer of the 1973 coup, and Pinochet’s minister of foreign relations for two years.\n\nCarabinero Repression\n\nThe casualties suffered by the social movement have been the worst since the dictatorship. The Carabineros use aggressive and unprovoked violence against demonstrators and onlookers, deploying tanks to spew toxic gases in large crowds and shooting tear gas canisters and rifles directly at protesters. Piñera has praised the force, while its commander, General Rozas, has stayed in the shadows. Indeed, the government has refused to remove him, despite repeated requests by political party leaders and social activists. Five human rights reports—authored by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), among others—have denounced the brutal and indiscriminate violence of the militarized police. Some 36 people have died, though exact tolls vary. The OHCHR reported that 28,000 people were jailed between October 18 and December 6, many arbitrarily. In a January 31 report, the Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos (INDH) noted that 427 persons had suffered mutilations of their eyes due to state violence. Some people have completely lost one or both eyes.Rights groups have documented how the Carabineros have aimed teargas canisters and rifles at people’s heads, against their own protocols. Police rifles were supposedly equipped with rubber bullets, but the University of Chile discovered police were firing shotgun pellets, with only a small proportion of rubber. The OHCHR, in its December 2019 report, decried “torture, ill-treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence” against those detained by the Carabineros and denounced the “unnecessary and disproportionate use of less-lethal weapons, in particular anti-riot shotguns, during peaceful demonstrations and/or outside the context of violent confrontations between demonstrators and security forces.” Videos circulated on social media show the Carabineros have used their vehicles to hit and crush people. They also have attacked medics, press people, and human rights observers with clearly marked signs and uniforms.On January 28, as fans were leaving a stadium in Santiago after a soccer game, a Carabinero truck traveling at high velocity hit a fan named Jorge Mora and kept driving. The incident was caught on video and went viral on social media, provoking enormous protests. Mora died before reaching the hospital. The same night, Piñera, said in an event, “When the Carabineros go out on the street they do so to protect public order.” The Carabinero driving the truck was detained, but the next day a court freed him and told him to sign in once a week at the police station. This ruling provoked even more outrage.\n\nHundreds of beatings of civilians, especially by groups of Carabineros, have been concentrated in Santiago Centro and in Puente Alto, singling out this working-class barrio in the southern part of the city. The INDH documented a total of 697 cases of squads of state agents attacking and beating lone civilians between the start of the uprising and January 31, including 123 incidents involving Carabineros, nine involving military men, and seven involving the investigative police. One notorious incident took place on January 29, when, after a protest over Jorge Mora’s death, seven or eight Carabineros attacked and savagely beat an18-year-old named Matías Soto. They left the youth on the sidewalk, with multiple fractures, jumped back into their van, and drove off. A security camera captured the entire assault. The INDH filed a lawsuit for torture in this case.\n\nIn addition to the police brutality, beloved symbols of popular culture have also suffered damage. The tomb of New Song folksinger Víctor Jara, who was tortured and murdered in 1973, was vandalized on January 18. The Víctor Jara Foundation organized a ceremony to clean and beautify the tomb, gathering musicians and the general public in the cemetery to dispel the aura of hatred. The Centro Arte Alameda, an arts center dating from 1992 near Plaza Italia, was burned and heavily damaged due to a fire in December. The center had provided space to medical personnel and people wounded in the demonstrations. While the fire is still under investigation, witnesses said Carabinero canisters started the blaze and videos seemed to verify that. On February 7, the Violeta Parra Museum, dedicated to the national artist and singer-songwriter, was burned after the Carabineros fired at least six flaming tear gas canisters at the building. Videos posted on Twitter as well as eyewitnesses documented this case.\n\nThe Protests Continue \n\nDespite the repression, Chileans continue to demonstrate almost every day, and large protests continue each Friday in Plaza Italia, popularly renamed Plaza de la Dignidad. The Carabineros mobilize in force on Fridays, and incidents invariably occur. The composition of the crowds has changed since the early days, when hundreds of thousands of people of all ages went to the plaza. Today, most of the demonstrators are young. They don gasmasks and bandanas, and some have begun fighting back when cornered by Carabineros. Some Carabineros have been injured, although statistics vary widely.\n\nThe Chilean people are determined, they are creative, and they are resilient. Protesters have worked with firefighters to put out fires started by tear gas canisters. Thousands of fans at soccer games have held up huge banners, denouncing the repression and chanting against Piñera. Bike riders have staged mass group rides to protest. People chant against the government in traditional festivals and carnivals. Popular musicians have played in large concerts and benefits to help victims of the violence, especially those who have lost eyes. Hundreds of women have performed the spoken feminist anthem “El violador eres tú” by Las Tésis, which has also been replicated around the world in different languages. Singers such as Nano Stern and Ana Tijoux have written songs about the rebellion and the state’s violence, while people continue to sing other songs, including the iconic, politically conscious music of Víctor Jara and Los Prisioneros. National poet Raúl Zurita wrote an anguished poem called “Venceremos” about the hundreds of eye injuries, which captures the solidarity of the Chileans with the words:\n\nAnd we will embrace each other weeping\n\nAnd we will embrace each other singing\n\nAnd my eyes will be your eyes\n\nAnd all Chile will be your eyes…\n\nPopular street murals, along with graffiti, cover the walls of central Santiago, and makeshift memorials and flowers mark the places where people died. Protesters carry a giant plaster statue of the “revolutionary dog” El Negro Matapacos—a street dog who accompanied students during the 2011 protests, and other later ones—along with other puppets, and some demonstrators dress as aliens or cartoon characters such as Pikachu.Piñera has made small concessions but has resisted any structural change to the neoliberal model. His response to social demands has been repression rather than dialogue. Piñera and his allies have pushed to enact a “security agenda” which has had some success in Congress. In January, Congress passed an “anti-looting law” that criminalized various protest tactics such as building barricades, blocking traffic, and wearing bandanas. The law is now in effect. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights had expressed alarm in a letter to Congress, stating: “Some of the legislative initiatives risk harming the exercise of a series of human rights, particularly…freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of expression…”\n\nThe Plebiscite and the Future of Chile\n\nWill the people of Chile be able to shape their own destiny via a plebiscite? Two months before the scheduled vote, the answer remains uncertain. Approval ratings of Chile’s institutions, including the Congress and the president’s office, rank at an all-time low in surveys. María, the protester, expressed her greatest hope for this process: “We want an end to this neoliberal system with its injustices and its inequalities, so people can live with more fairness and more dignity,” she said. “We want to end the Constitution of Pinochet and to move toward a state with social justice.” Her greatest fear? “That nothing will change.”\n\nThe month of March will be definitive in this struggle. Schools begin again and Chileans return to daily life. Chileans are very clear that they want a new political and socioeconomic model that assures their rights. Their struggle to transform the state has implications for all of Latin America, and indeed, for the world. Chile represents the hope that “people power” can overcome extreme versions of neoliberalism and restricted forms of politics to achieve new, more democratic systems of governance.",

On Thursday, the 42-year-old was one of about 200 people wearing face masks and standing 6 feet apart in the Clark County Government Center’s outdoor amphitheater for the ceremony.\n\n“That night I lost a part of me, and I come back looking for it,” Soto said, with tears in her eyes.\n\nSince October 2017, Soto has moved from California to Minneapolis and has started her dream job as a flight attendant. She said that she decided to “live life to the fullest” for those who died in the attack.\n\nA slideshow during the ceremony displayed the names and pictures of the 58 people killed that night. The pictures of two women who died within the past year of injuries they suffered in the mass shooting were included at the end with a message reading, “In Memoriam of 1 October Victims Lost in the Last Year.”At the end of the ceremony, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced that the two women, Kimberly Gervais of Mira Loma, California, and Samanta Arjune of Las Vegas, will be added to the official death toll, raising the number from 58 to 60.\n\nThe announcement came after the Review-Journal on Monday published an article that highlighted their deaths and reported the Metropolitan Police Department’s initial decision not to include them in the death total.“It isn’t like we’re trying to avoid the names,” Lombardo said in a brief interview after the ceremony. He later added that, “At this point, I think I’m comfortable in acknowledging that the other two individuals lost their lives as a result of 1 October.”\n\nThere were fewer people at the ceremony this year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced officials to limit the number of people who could attend. Gov. Steve Sisolak, who also addressed the crowd, said that when he raised the limit on public gatherings this week, Thursday’s event was one of his “biggest priorities.”Sisolak’s voice grew shaky as he recalled that night and offered his condolences to the family members of those who died.\n\n“We will never, never forget what happened that day, or the lives that were lost, and the lives that were changed,” he said.\n\nAlbert Rivera, the father of Jordyn Rivera, who was 21 when she was killed in the attack, said he was thankful to all the survivors who continue to come together on the anniversary and support each other.\n\n“We are all a statistic — we are all part of this unwanted fraternity we didn’t chose to be a part of,” he said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged Greg Zanis, an Illinois carpenter who built 58 crosses honoring those who died in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Zanis died in May of terminal bladder cancer, and Rivera said he will “be forever changed” by Zanis’ kindness.\n\nHe ended his remarks by calling for unity during what he said has been a time of divisiveness in the U.S. He urged people to remember how they came together on Oct. 2, 2017.\n\n“It’s said that it takes more effort to hate than to love. Let’s remember that,” he said. “Until we meet again — here, there or in the air — may we all smile like Jordyn.”",

But they have left a trail of poverty, said Pisanu, pointing out that the 22% of Italians living under the shadow of the mob produced just 14.6% of Italy's GDP and held just 12.4% of the country's bank deposits.\n\nIn Catania and Palermo 80% of shops allegedly pay protection money, starting from €500 a month.\n\nSuspicious fires, possibly to pressure businesses into paying protection money, in the four regions studied by Censis doubled to 8,441 a year between 1998 and 2007.\n\nInvestigators believe Italy's clans are now investing more of their profits from extortion and drug dealing outside the Italian south, including in building work at the site for Milan's Expo in 2015.\n\nThe Camorra and the 'Ndrangheta are suspected of carving up investments in Rome, with the former focusing on suburban shopping centres and the latter on luxury property and restaurants in the heart of the capital. Despite the stalled Italian economy, a large number of bars in Rome have recently received expensive makeovers, which Pisanu said was probably due to an influx of mob money.\n\n\"As we get better at confiscating funds in Italy, the mafias are also getting better at investing overseas,\" he said. \"The 'Ndrangheta has even offered to act as a financial services consultant to the Columbian cartels.\"",

The launch team confirmed that they received a signal from the spacecraft confirming it was safe and healthy just after 7 a.m. ET and that Lucy successfully deployed its impressive solar arrays.\nLucy will embark on a 12-year mission to explore Jupiter's Trojan asteroid swarms, which have never been observed. The Trojan asteroids, which borrow their name from Greek mythology, orbit the sun in two swarms -- one that's ahead of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, and a second one that lags behind it.\nSo far, our only glimpses of the Trojans have been artist renderings or animations. Lucy will provide the first high-resolution images of what these asteroids look like.\nThis illustration shows the Lucy spacecraft passing one of the Trojan asteroids near Jupiter.\nThis illustration shows the Lucy spacecraft passing one of the Trojan asteroids near Jupiter.\nLucy is the first spacecraft designed to visit and observe these asteroids, which are remnants from the early days of our solar system. The mission will help researchers effectively peer back in time to learn how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. Lucy's 12-year mission could also help scientists learn how our planets ended up in their current spots.\n\"At the heart of Lucy is the science and how it's going to talk to us about the Trojans,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.\nA photo from Lucy&#39;s successful launch early Saturday morning.\nA photo from Lucy's successful launch early Saturday morning.\n\"It's so important to go observe them because these asteroids tell us about a chapter of our own story -- in this case, the history when the outer planets were forming in the solar system,\" Zurbuchen said. \"I'm still amazed by the fact that if you pick up a rock or you look at one of those planetary bodies and you add science to it, it turns into a history book.\"\nVisiting mysterious asteroids\nThere are about 7,000 Trojan asteroids, and the largest is 160 miles (250 kilometers) across. The asteroids represent the leftover material still hanging around after the giant planets in our solar system, including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, formed. Even though they share an orbit with Jupiter, the asteroids are still very distant from the planet itself -- almost as far away as Jupiter is from the sun, according to NASA.\nFastest orbiting asteroid found in our solar system\nFastest orbiting asteroid found in our solar system\nThe spacecraft is set to fly by an asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and then it will explore seven of the Trojans. Over the course of its mission, Lucy will end up swinging back to Earth's orbit three separate times for gravity assists that can slingshot it on the right path. That will make Lucy the first spacecraft to travel to Jupiter and return to Earth.\nThis graphic shows Lucy&#39;s impressive trajectory to reach the asteroids over 12 years.\nThis graphic shows Lucy's impressive trajectory to reach the asteroids over 12 years.\nThe mission borrows its name from the Lucy fossil, the remains of an ancient human ancestor discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. The skeleton has helped researchers piece together aspects of human evolution, and the NASA Lucy team members hope their mission will achieve a similar feat regarding the history of our solar system.\nThe Trojans \"are held there by the gravitational effect of Jupiter and the sun, so if you put an object there early in the solar system's history, it's been stable forever,\" said Hal Levison, the principal investigator of the Lucy mission, based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \"These things really are the fossils of what planets formed from.\"\nHow did Lucy, our early human ancestor, die 3 million years ago?\nHow did Lucy, our early human ancestor, die 3 million years ago?\nBoth the fossil and the mission are a nod to the Beatles tune \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,\" which is why the logo for the Lucy mission includes a diamond.\nOver 12 years, Lucy will travel nearly 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) moving at about 400,000 miles per hour (17,881.6 meters per second).\nLucy will specifically visit these asteroids, all named for heroes you might recognize from Homer's \"The Iliad\": Eurybates, Queta, Polymele, Leucus, Orus, Patroclus and Menoetius.\nNASA&#39;s Lucy mission will explore seven Trojan asteroids.\nThis illustration shows the binary asteroid Patroclus/Menoetius, Eurybates, Orus, Leucus, Polymele and the main belt asteroid DonaldJohanson.\nNASA's Lucy mission will explore seven Trojan asteroids. This illustration shows the binary asteroid Patroclus/Menoetius, Eurybates, Orus, Leucus, Polymele and the main belt asteroid DonaldJohanson.\nEurybates was chosen because it's the largest remnant of an ancient massive collision, meaning that it could reveal a look at what's inside an asteroid. Observations made using the Hubble Space Telescope found that the small asteroid named Queta is a satellite of Eurybates.\nEach of the asteroids Lucy will fly by differ in size and color.\n\"One of the really surprising things about the Trojans when we started to study them from the ground is just how different they are from one another,\" Levison said. \" So if you want to understand what this population is telling us about how the planets formed, you need to understand that diversity and that's what Lucy is intended to do.\"\nA feat of engineering\nThe Lucy spacecraft is more than 46 feet (14 meters) from tip to tip, largely due to its giant solar panels -- each about the width of a school bus -- designed to keep up a power supply to the spacecraft's instruments. But Lucy also has fuel to help it execute some skilled maneuvers on the way to the asteroids.\nIt took a team of more than 500 engineers and scientists to conceptualize and build the spacecraft, said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.\nNASA spacecraft carrying history-making asteroid sample now heading toward Earth\nNASA spacecraft carrying history-making asteroid sample now heading toward Earth\n\"Lucy will be NASA's first mission to travel this far away from the sun without nuclear power,\" said Joan Salute, associate director for flight programs at NASA's Planetary Science Division.\"In order to generate enough energy, Lucy has two very large circular solar arrays that open up like Chinese fans. These open up autonomously and simultaneously, and it happens about one hour after launch.\"\nLucy will use three science instruments to study the asteroids, including color and black-and-white cameras, a thermometer, and an infrared imaging spectrometer to determine the composition of the asteroids' surface materials. The spacecraft will communicate with Earth using its antenna, which also can be used to help determine the masses of the asteroids.\nThe nearly assembled Lucy spacecraft is shown in late 2020.\nThe nearly assembled Lucy spacecraft is shown in late 2020.\nThe instruments will enable the science team to search for satellites around these asteroids as well as craters on their surfaces, which can help determine their ages as well as the origin and evolution of the asteroids.\nLucy will fly by the asteroids at about 15,000 miles per hour (6,705 meters per second), about four times slower than when NASA's New Horizons spacecraft zipped by Pluto and the distant object Arrokoth, said Hal Weaver, principal investigator for Lucy's L'LORRI instrument at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.\nThis long exposure image, taken over 2 minutes and 30 seconds, captures the beauty of the early morning launch.\nThis long exposure image, taken over 2 minutes and 30 seconds, captures the beauty of the early morning launch.\nLucy will also be about 600 miles (965 kilometers) away from each asteroid during its flyby, as opposed to around 2,000 miles (3,218 kilometers) away from the Arrokoth flyby, which means the Trojan images will have four times better resolution.\nOnce the Lucy mission has finished, the team plans to propose an extended mission to explore more Trojans. The spacecraft will remain in a stable orbit that retraces the path of its exploration between Earth and Jupiter, and it won't have a chance of colliding with either for over 100,000 years. Eventually, if the orbit does grow unstable, it will likely head on a doomed mission to the sun or get kicked out of our solar system.",

The preliminary report also does not mention whether any fuel was recovered from the wreckage, whether any fuel odour could be noticed at the accident site, and does not provide any insight into the fuel management (e.g. how much fuel was on board on departure, and how much fuel should have been or was on board when the aircraft intercepted the localizer).\n\nOn Oct 8th 2021 the NBAAI released their final report concluding the probable causes of the accident were:\n\nThe most probable cause of the accident, collision of a serviceable aircraft with the ground during the landing approach in a dense fog, was the crew’s failure to perform the flight in the instrument conditions due to the probable physical excessive fatigue, which led to an unconscious descent of the aircraft below the glide path and ground impact.\n\nContributing Factors\n\nProbable exceeding the aircraft takeoff weight during departure from the Vigo Airport, which could result in increase in consumption of the fuel, the remainder of which did not allow to perform the flight to the alternate Boryspil aerodrome.\n\nThe NBAAI reported all engines and propellers were servicable at the time of the accident, the engines did respond properly to crew inputs. The fuel system was servicable and supplied fuel as needed for takeoff mode at the time of accident until the aircraft came to a rest. No defects or technical malfunctions were found with the aircraft or any of its systems. During takeoff from Vigo the takeoff mass possibly exceeded the maximum takeoff mass by as much as 5400kg. The fuel remaining while on approach to Lviv did not permit to divert to Kiev Borispol. The crew departed from Vigo without necessary rest, the crew did not comply with the regulations regarding work hours and rest times.\n\nThe NBAAI reported there were 650kg of fuel remaining during the accident approach to Lviv. About 170 liters of fuel could be drained from the wing tanks of the wreckage, the wing tanks has not been damaged.\n\nThe NBAAI analysed:\n\nDue to the absence of the flight assignment, logbook, calculations of take-off weight and aircraft CG, performed by the crew before departure, the Investigation Team could not accurately establish the aircraft take-off weight and CG. But taking into account the information received from the Vigo airport about the commercial cargo weight, documents on the cargo, the amount of fuel filled, and information received from the cockpit crew communication, the Investigation Team calculated that the take-off weight of the aircraft during departure could make 66,400 kg.\n\nNote: according to the An-12BK Aircraft Flight Operation Manual, par 2.2, the maximum take-off weight shall be 61,000 kg.\n\nThe NBAAI analysed that the aircraft performance until climbing through 6600 meters suggested the aircraft was overloaded. The aircraft reached initial flight level FL240 96 minutes after departure and climbed to cruise FL250 another 86 minutes later.\n\nThe AAIB analysed the final approach:\n\nAt 03:22:25, the crew requested clearance from the controller of the Lviv ACC to descend to FL120, and, having received clearance at 03:22:40, began the descent and landing approach using the radar vectoring method as instructed by the controller.\n\nThere were no deviations in the operation of the engines based on the results of FDR decoding, and according to the crew reports based on the results of CVR decoding.\n\nAt 03:40:00 UTC, the height over the RW-31 threshold was 1170 m, descent rate -4 ... -4.5 m/s, flight speed 352 km/h, distance 15.70 km;\n\nAt 03:40:20 UTC, at a distance of 16.1 ... 14.7 km, the aircraft, in the process of descent, completes the turn and enters the final;\n\nAt 03:41:10 UTC, at a distance of 11 km, the aircraft is 70 m above the glide path. The estimated height of the point of entry into the glide path is 590 m, the actual height is 660 m. The indicated speed was recorded at 320 km/h. The vertical rate of descent was -6.5 m/s. The aircraft decreases and approaches the glide path;\n\nAt 03:40:01 UTC, the crew reported on the localizer capture beam for the ILS approach to Runway 31. The controller instructed to continue the ILS approach to Runway 31. The mean vertical descent rate was 4 ... 4.5 m/s.\n\nAt 03:40:30 UTC, the crew extended the landing gear at a distance of 13.9 km (according to recorders).\n\nNote: according to the Aircraft Flight Manual, the landing gear shall be extended before flaps are extended by 15º at a distance of at least 18 km. Thus, the crew released the landing gear with a 4 km delay.\n\nAt 03:41:16 UTC, at a distance of 11.6 km, the crew began to deploy the flaps to 15 degrees. The instrument speed was 326 km/h.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual, when approaching the landing, the flaps shall be deployed in three stages: at 15º, at 25º, at 35º. The maximum flight speed with flaps at 15º shall be 340 km/h. Thus, the flaps were extended at a lower speed than established by the Flight Operation Manual.\n\nAfter the flaps were deployed by 15 degrees, one of the crew members (flight engineer) reported of the aircraft configuration: \"15, landing gear extended, landing weight 53\".\n\nAt 03:41:36 UTC, at a distance of 10.64 km to the glide slope beacon, additionally flaps were extended by 20 degrees, the flight speed was 316 km/h.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual, the maximum flight speed with flaps extended at 25º shall be 340 km/h.\n\nAt 03:42:24 UTC, at a distance of 8.0 km from the glide slope beacon, the aircraft reaches the glide path. At a distance of 7.9 km, the aircraft crosses the glide path and continues to gradually descend below the glide path.\n\nAt that time, the internal engines were operating in the IKM2 – 10, IKM3 - 12 modes, the external engines were operating in the IKM1 – 19, IKM4 - 12 modes.\n\nNote: during the descent, it is necessary to balance the aircraft with the trims so that the aircraft steadily maintains the specified flight mode.\n\nIn the time interval 03:42:55 ... 03:43:00 at a distance of 4.7 ... 4.4 km, the crew extended the flaps to 35 degrees. The aircraft was below the glide path and continued to descend. 3-4 seconds after the flaps were extended, the thrust of the external engines increased and the vertical rate of descent began to increase.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual, flaps shall be extended to 35º before entrance to the glide path at a speed of 280-300 km/h. Thus, flaps at 35º were extended much later, when there were 4 km to the runway.\n\nAccording to the Flight Operation Manual, the extension of the flaps from 15º to 35º is accompanied by the aircraft's tendency to pitch up (an increase in the pitch angle) and a noticeable decrease in the gliding speed. Therefore, this desire should be countered by a smooth movement of the steering wheel away from a pilot and, if necessary, increase the engine thrust mode. Despite the fact that the plane was below the glide path, the situation became dangerous.\n\nAt 03:43:24 UTC, at a distance of 2.86 km from the runway threshold, the crew increased the thrust mode of the external engines to 42-43 by the engine torquemeter, while the vertical descent rate was 4-5 m/s, which exceeds the rate established for the Lviv aerodrome. The aircraft moved below the glide path by 65 m. The actual altitude was 105 m. After 7-8 seconds, the vertical descent rate increases again, the aircraft descended further below the glide path, the operating mode of the external engines increased to 55 by the engine torquemeter.\n\nAt 03:43:32 UTC, at an altitude of 60 m, at a distance of 1980 m from the runway threshold, the radio altimeter alarm “Decision Altitude” was triggered, but none of the crew members responded to it and the aircraft continued to descend.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual par 4.7.1, if a radio altimeter alarm is triggered to establish a reliable visual contact with the lights of the aerodrome lighting equipment or other landmarks along the landing course, an urgent go-around maneuver should be started.\n\nAt 03:43:34 UTC, at a distance of 1.67 km from the displaced threshold of the runway, the mode of the internal engines for a short time, for 3-4 seconds, increased and then decreased to 22-30, the vertical speed was 4 m/s, the height was 48 m (40m below the glide path), the speed was 244 km/h.\n\nNote: according to the Flight Operation Manual Table 4.6, rate of descent with a landing weight of 50 - 55 t and flaps 35º should be 270 km/h. Thus, the crew did not control the speed and flew at a speed that was 26 km/h less than those established in the flight manual.\n\nAt an height of about 30 m over the runway threshold (20 m over the ground surface), 2-3 seconds before collision with trees, the elevator deviates to pitching-up by about 75% of the maximum value, but these actions were not enough to reduce the vertical speed and the aircraft continued descend with a vertical speed of 6 m/s and at a height of 5-7 m from the ground surface (15-17 m from the threshold of the runway) at a distance of 1500-1600 m from the threshold of the runway collided with trees. After a collision with trees, the recording on the recorder discontinued.\n\nDuring the flight along the glide path (navigator) provides commands to correct the direction of movement along the course, however, none of the crew members reported about the position of the aircraft relative to the glide path.\n\nDuring the flight along the glide path (navigator) reports the distance to the runway threshold (according to the extract of the crew's communication), which corresponds within an error of 150-200 m to the calculated distance according to the recorded coordinates of the aircraft.\n\nFrom an altitude of 100 m until the moment of collision with obstacles (flight engineer) reports the altitude by radio altimeters every 10 meters.\n\nAnalysis of the aircraft landing approach parameters at a distance of 11,000 meters, obtained from the recorders data, shows that the crew increased the instrument speed three times by increasing the vertical speed. So, at a distance of 8000 meters from the displaced threshold of the runway, the crew, after a slight loss of the indicated speed, increased the vertical speed to 6 m/s (established as 4 m/s), at a distance of 4200 meters from the displaced threshold of the runway, the crew, after losing the indicated speed, increased the vertical speed up to 5.5 m/s, with its subsequent decrease to 3 m/s, at a distance of 2000 meters from the displaced threshold of the runway and Habsolute=48 m, after the loss of the indicated speed to 237 km/h, the crew made a third attempt to increase the indicated speed for by increasing the vertical speed.\n\nThis approach procedure indicates inadequate actions of the PIC.\n\nWhen inspecting the accident site, the Investigation Team found devices of the aircraft instrument landing system, and found that the glide slope and heading alarm flags were turned off.",

In the southwestern and south central United States, toxic marine algae have been killing fish in freshwater lakes since 2000.\n\nHigher carbon dioxide levels\nAlgae need carbon dioxide to survive. Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air and water can lead to rapid growth of algae, especially toxic blue-green algae that can float to the surface of the water.\n\nChanges in rainfall   Extreme storms followed by periods of drought can lead to more algal blooms like this one seen in Iowa in 2011.\nClimate change might affect rainfall patterns, leading to alternating periods of drought and intense storms.

There it carried out tests related to orbit control and observations of the Earth and Sun.\n\nNew data from satellite trackers now suggests Chang’e-5 has left its orbit around Sun-Earth L1 and is destined for a lunar flyby early September 9 Eastern time.It was noted that Chang’e-5 may have altered its orbit Aug. 30 based on observations by and data from amateur satellite trackers Daniel Estevez and Scott Tilley and independent astronomy software developer Bill Gray. \n\nThe spacecraft is under the control of the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center (BACC), which is responsible for telemetry, tracking and command of spacecraft. BACC has not yet provided an update on the plans for Chang’e-5.\n\nPotential maneuvers such as entering lunar orbit, heading for another Sun-Earth Lagrange point or an Earth-moon Lagrange point depend on how much propellant the orbiter has remaining. Another possibility could be using the flyby to set Chang’e-5 on a trajectory to flyby 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, a quasi-satellite of Earth and the target for China’s 2024 near Earth asteroid sample-return mission.\n\nJing Peng, deputy chief designer of the Chang’e-5 spacecraft system at the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), said during the Global Space Exploration (GLEX) conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, in June, that a visit to a planetary body such as Venus may not be possible due to a lack of propellant.\n\n“I don’t think there will be many opportunities for the orbiter to perform more complex orbit maneuvers with other bodies,” he said. “I think it will stay in Lagrange point 1 or the Earth-moon system,” Peng said.\n\nSamples collected by the Chang’e-5 lander from near Mons Rümker in Oceanus Procellarum in the northwest of the near side of the moon are now being analyzed. Applications for sample materials are now open to domestic and international institutions. \n\nNASA currently has no plans to trade any of its Apollo-era lunar samples with those returned by China’s Chang’e-5 mission, although the agency’s chief scientist Jim Green expressed hope for such an exchange in the future.\n\nChina is planning a followup lunar sample-return, Chang’e-6, in 2024 which is nominally part of the joint China-Russia International Lunar Research Station. The French space agency will contribute a science payload to Chang’e-6.\n\nChina’s Lunar and Planetary Data System earlier this month provided a rare update on the ongoing Chang’e-4 lunar far side mission. The Yutu-2 rover has now covered roughly 799 metres across 33 completed lunar days since landing in Von Kármán crater in January 2019.",

    "content": "Santiago – Chile has been gripped by protests against high living costs and inequality for nearly two weeks. \n\nAngry over President Sebastian Pinera‘s response to the protests, demonstrators are calling for him to step down. Although the country is no longer under a state of emergency, which was initially declared after the demonstrations began, protests have continued, with frequent clashes between police and protesters. Police have used tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and pellets, prompting allegations of rights abuses.\n\nLooting has also taken place and supermarkets and petrol stations have been set on fire.\n\nAt least 20 civilians have been killed, according to officials.\n\nIt is the worst violence the country has witnessed since the 17-year-long military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, which ended in 1990.\n\nDespite the unrest, the majority of protesters have been peaceful, with many banging spoons against cooking pots – a form of protest known as cacerolazo.\n\nAs the protests continue, Al Jazeera examines the underlying reasons behind the protests in what is considered one of South America’s most stable countries.\n\n1. How did the protests start, and who was behind them?\nThe protests began as a student-led demonstration against transport fares.\n\nIn early October, the government announced that the metro rush hour prices would rise by 30 pesos ($0.04).\n\nResponding to public outcry against the rising fare, then-Minister of Economy Juan Andres Fontaine announced that those upset with the price rise could wake up earlier and pay a lower rate.\n\n“When the costs rise, there are not many options,” he said at the time.\n\nOutrage grew after the remarks, leading students to conduct a mass fare evasion by jumping over the metro turnstiles, and, in some instances, destroying them.\n\n“Evade, and not pay, is another way of fighting,” they chanted at the time. According to Victor Villegas, a sociologist at Santiago’s Alberto Hurtado University, “it’s not a coincidence” that the movement began with high school students because “they have always driven Chilean social movements”.\n\n“Since the dictatorship, they have been involved in political movements, and this time again, they again took the baton and started the protests,” he said.\n\nAs police attempted to stop the students at the stations with force, the protests spilled out into the streets.\n\nMetro stations, supermarkets, and petrol stations were burned, leading the president to declare a state of emergency.2. Are the protests still about the metro prices?\nThe anger goes far beyond the cost of transport.\n\nChileans are also frustrated with the increasing cost of living, low wages and pensions, a lack of education rights, a poor public health system and crippling inequality.\n\n“The 30 cents ($0.04) were just the tip of the iceberg,” said Jacinta Urivi, a 29-year-old publicist who has been taken part in the street protests since they began.\n\n“We don’t have good public health, the salaries are low – there are so many things that act against the people, that they (the politicians) fill their pockets with. I am proud and happy that people are waking up,” Urivi told Al Jazeera.According to Jose Miguel Ahumada, a political economist and associate professor at the University of Chile, the country is “one of the most unequal countries in Latin America”. \n\n“Highly unequal societies invest less in human capital, invest less in education, and produce more social problems,” he said. \n\n3. What are the protesters demands?\nThe protesters’ demands vary, but many have called for a change to the pension system and an increase of the minimum wage in addition to Pinera’s resignation. Although Pinera has addressed both in his reform plans, protesters are frustrated that his proposals come at a cost to the state, rather than to the private industries. \n\nPinera’s brother, Jose Pinera, is the mastermind of the current privatised pension system, which was introduced during the dictatorship. There are calls to completely change model to a more social scheme. \n\nThere are also demands for a new constitution, as the current one was introduced in the dictatorship. \n\n “We want a constitutional assembly to write a new constitution” says Iraci Hassler, a Santiago councilwoman. “One that prioritises the lives of human beings above private property” 4. What has been Pinera’s response?\nResponding to the protests, Pinera initially declared a state of emergency, which allowed for the suspension of certain freedoms, including movement and assembly. It also meant military forces were deployed to the streets and curfews were enforced. \n\nMany criticised Pinera’s decision to declare the state of emergency so quickly, without addressing the public first.\n\nHe justified the decision, saying he wanted to maintain public order against vandals and crime.\n\nBut after a mass protest on Friday, which saw more than one million people rally in cities across the country, Pinera opted for a more positive approach.\n\n“We are all listening and understanding,” he said in a statement. \n\nHe lifted the state of emergency on Sunday, and a day later he replaced eight of his cabinet members, including the minister of the economy and Andres Chadwick, Pinera’s cousin and minister of internal affairs, who called protesters “criminals”.  \n\nThe unpopular education, health and transport ministers were kept in their positions, however. The new ministers were also criticised for having little experience.\n\nPinera has also proposed new social reforms, including a rise in the minimum wage, an increase in the state pension and the stabilisation of the costs of electricity. \n\nAlthough some welcomed the reforms, others said they did not go far enough. \n\n“The state continues paying, without touching the profits of the companies,” said Hassler, the councilwoman. “There’s a problem that the right wing are not understanding.”\n\nChile was set to host the APEC trade summit next month, and the climate change summit COP25 in December, but Pinera backed out of the events on Wednesday, saying he had to prioritise “re-establishing public order”.\n\n5. How many people have died? How many have been arrested?\nVideos have surfaced on social media showing the military and police hitting, shooting and running over civilians on the street.\n\nOfficials have said that 20 people have died as a result of the unrest, including 11 who died in arson attempts, looting and rioting and five who were killed by military officials.On Tuesday, the National Institute of Human Rights (INDH) said more than 1,233 civilians had gone to hospital with injuries from the unrest. At least 688 of those injured had wounds caused by weapons, according to the institute. Thousands have also been arrested. \n\nUN investigators arrived in the country on Monday after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for an independent investigation into the deaths and “disturbing allegations” of excessive force used on protesters. \n\nPinera welcomed the investigators, saying “we have nothing to hide”. \n\nSergio Micco, the head of the INDH, criticised the police after one of his team members was shot seven times by metal pellets on Tuesday.\n\n“It’s fine for the police to harshly confronts the looting, but they must respect demonstrations that are carried out peacefully,” he said. \n\nResponding to the criticism, the director of the Chilean police said protesters “want to criminalise us because we are fulfilling a constitutional mandate to restore public order”. He also emphasised that many allegations of abuse have yet to be properly investigated. \n\n6. Is there any sign of the unrest calming?\nPinera’s concessions have so far failed to satisfy protesters, with many vowing to stay in the streets until he steps down. \n\nGreater reforms for social services will have to be introduced if the government hopes to ease any tensions going forward, according to analysts.\n\n“Chileans feel like they are losing public participation” in political decision making, Villegas, the sociologist, said. “That they are treated as subjects of consumerism more than people with rights.”",

    "content": "On 12 March, a 33-year-old salesman disembarked from a flight from Dubai at an airport in southern India, feeling very sick.\n\nHe was suffering from the chills, dry cough and breathlessness.\n\nAirport officials quickly moved him to hospital in the city of Trivandrum in Kerala state, where they tested him for coronavirus.\n\nThen they put him in an ambulance and sent him home to his village in Kasargod district, some 564 km (350 miles) away.\n\nChengala is a cluster of four wooded settlements where 66,000 people live. Most are engaged in farming paddy and vegetables.\n\nMany others, like the young salesman, are among the more than two million people from Kerala who work outside the country, including in the Gulf states.\n\nWhen the man reached Chengala, local village council members immediately reached out and the local public health centre took down his details.\n\nThey asked him to isolate himself from his wife and three children. So the man began living alone in a shed outside his house.\n\nSix days later, his test came back as positive. By that time, he was already in isolation in his home. Later, he was taken to hospital, where he recovered. After returning home, the salesman is still living in isolation \"just for safety\".\n\n\"We were ready from the very beginning. We realised a storm was coming. So we began erecting our defences,\" Shahina Saleem, the president of the 23-member local village council, told me. These elected village councils are the lowest tier of governance in India.\n\nOver the last month, Chengala has reported 22 cases of Covid-19 infection and quarantined more than 400 people. Twenty patients have recovered in hospital and returned home. More than 370 samples have been tested at hospitals some 8km away. Results usually arrive in 48 hours.\nThe local village council galvanised local health and community workers and opened a community kitchen to feed the people in isolation.\n\nThey have been providing free lunches for more than 1,200 people in the area - local residents and stranded migrant workers. Local health officers are making sure that villagers on medication get their pills on time.\n\nUsing a local helpline and two WhatsApp groups, the council encouraged local villagers to accommodate people who were in isolation and didn't have enough space for social distancing at home. Two-dozen families vacated floors and even homes for this. Everyone in isolation now has to observe a 28-day quarantine.\n\nKerala, many believe, has turned out to be a striking outlier in the battle against the virus in India. The world's second-most populous country has reported more than 9,750 cases and 377 deaths from the contagion so far.\n\nIn the beginning, the odds seemed to be stacked against the picturesque southern state, which is a major tourist location. In January, it reported the first Covid-19 case in India. The number of cases rose steadily, and it became a hotspot. Two months later, half a dozen states are reporting more infections than Kerala.\nKerala has porous borders, a large number of migrant workers, and a huge expatriate population who keep travelling back and forth and whose remittances oil the state's economy.\n\nMore than two months after the outbreak of the pandemic, the state has reported three deaths and more than 370 confirmed cases of the infection. More than 100,000 people remain in isolation, at home or in designated facilities.\n\nMany believe Kerala has flattened the curve at a time when the infection is on the rise all over India.\nTo be sure, the state has been alert and vigilant. It imposed a lockdown a day before the nationwide one, on 25 March. It did rigorous contact tracing, using detailed \"route maps\" of people coming in from abroad. It set up Covid-19 care centres in all districts to accommodate outsiders who were stuck and had been advised to isolate.\n\nHealth workers supported people with special needs and the elderly living alone. Counsellors made more than 340,000 telephone calls to personnel working in affected areas to counsel them on how to handle stress.\n\nIt's not that Kerala tested aggressively. Testing was bound strictly by and limited to federal protocols. More than a dozen labs are testing 800 samples a day.\nBut, experts say, what really mattered in the end was Kerala's robust public health system, and a culture of thriving grassroots democracy with power devolving effectively to the village councils. This mainly helped in community outreach, rigorous contact tracing and mass quarantine. The Communist government released abundant information about the developments every day, analysts say.\n\n\"A strong game-changer was the decentralised health care system. And village councils took upon themselves to enforce and monitor mass quarantine with the consent of the people. The shutdown also helped,\" B Ekbal, a neurosurgeon and head of an expert panel advising the government on prevention of the virus, told me.\n\nEconomists like Jacob John believe that the devolution of power in Kerala - local government, community-driven village councils, vigilant municipalities - have helped the state tackle two consecutive floods and an outbreak of the vicious Nipah virus in the last three years.\n\nThe three-tier public health system, involving functioning government hospitals, is the result of a more than half-century long legacy of spending on healthcare. \"Kerala,\" says Dr John, \"has spent more on health and education than most Indian states.\"\n\nBreathless media reports of Kerala \"flattening the curve\" could be premature, officials warn.\nLike in the rest of India, much of the testing has been limited and delayed.\n\nMass screening with antibody tests has been delayed because about 100,000 kits which the state ordered haven't arrived yet.\n\nFresh cases haven't dried up completely. Kerala also \"got lucky\", as one doctor told me - the average age of infected people here is 37 years old, and the majority of them are Gulf returnees.\n\n\"It's not counter-intuitive. Some 70% of our Covid-19 patients have come from outside the country,\" says Dr Ekbal. This in a state where more than 12% of the population are over 60 years old.\n\nAlso, worryingly, Kerala has one of the highest rates of communicable diseases - one that spreads from one person to another - in India. A large number of people also suffer from diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory and liver diseases.\n\nThe summer monsoon rains, which begin in June, usually trigger a spike in diseases like influenza, dengue and scrub typhus. Fever is a common symptom in many of these diseases. \"This can complicate diagnosis. To make sure we don't end up facing a fresh wave of infections during the rains, we have to very vigilant during the monsoon,\" says a doctor.\n\nSuch heightened vigilance - controlling inflows of people across the border and isolating suspects - will come at an economic cost. The government has worked out a painstakingly detailed plan for the phased opening up of the state when infections stop.\nSo far Kerala has stuck to the script and done it well it, say analysts. Cases have slowed down, recoveries are high and the mortality rate is low. It helped that it had a smaller population (33 million) than many other states and also a highly literate one.\n\n\"We have won the quarter-final,\" says Sreejith N Kumar, a doctor. \"The semi-final would be a staggered easing up without a second wave of infection. And the final would be a return to normal life.\"\n\n\"Only then we can say we won the game.\"",

    "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard finally got to compete at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIt didn’t last long, but it was significant. Hubbard couldn’t complete any of her first three lifts on Monday night, ruling her out of medal contention in the women’s over-87-kilogram division that ultimately was won by China’s Li Wenwen.\n\nHubbard made a heart gesture to the audience with her hands before leaving the competition arena.\n\nEven without completing a lift, she was a pioneer for transgender athletes.\n\nWhile the New Zealander isn’t the only transgender athlete competing at the Tokyo Games, she has been out for years and has been the focus of attention as a medal contender in weightlifting.\n\n“Of course, I’m not entirely unaware of the controversy which surrounds my participation in these Games,” Hubbard said after exiting the competition. “And, as such, I’d particularly like to thank the IOC, for, I think, really affirming their commitment to the principles of Olympism, and establishing that sport is something for all people. It is inclusive. It is accessible.”\n\nHubbard also thanked the International Weightlifting Federation, because “they too have shown that weightlifting is an activity that’s open to all of the people in the world,” and the people of Japan for hosting the Games under extraordinary circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hubbard received applause and also applauded her fellow athletes when they were introduced on stage. Returning to compete, she took a moment to close her eyes, smile and take a deep breath. She overbalanced on her opening weight of 120 kilograms, taking the bar behind her shoulders.\n\nHer second effort of 125 kilograms — a weight Hubbard has often managed in previous competitions — was ruled invalid on a majority decision by the referees. With New Zealand teammates and staff calling out encouragement, the third attempt was almost a repeat of the first.\n\nAthletes are eliminated if they do not record at least one valid lift in each of the two parts of the competition.\n\nLi’s victory gave China its seventh gold medal in weightlifting at the Tokyo Games. Her rivals never got close to the 320-kilogram winning total, with Emily Campbell finishing 37 kilograms behind to take silver. She became the first British woman to win a weightlifting medal.\n\nSarah Robles of the United States repeated her bronze from 2016 with 282, becoming the first U.S. woman with two weightlifting medals. Robles was challenging for second place, but had her last lift ruled invalid for elbow movement. “The refs should be doing their jobs so they’re doing it. It is really, really strict but if there’s anytime to be strict, it should be at the Olympics,” Robles said.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee in 2015 drew up a set of recommendations for including transgender athletes. Many sports bodies, including the IWF, have implemented similar policies based on those recommendations. Different sports are allowed to set their own specific policies.\n\nIn weightlifting, that includes a requirement for athletes to show their testosterone is below a certain level after transitioning, a requirement which Hubbard met. She won a silver medal at the 2017 world championships but had not competed for 1 1/2 years before Tokyo because the coronavirus pandemic hit the competition schedule.\n\n“My performance wasn’t what I had hoped but I’m humbled by the support I’ve received from so many people around New Zealand,” Hubbard said in a statement released by the New Zealand team.”\n\nThe IOC will release a new “framework” for transgender athletes’ eligibility in the coming months. That document is expected to take into account newer scientific studies published since the last major review in 2015. That will form a basis for sports to draw up their own updated policies.\n\nThe New Zealand Olympic Committee recognized the sometimes-bitter discussions over what conditions should apply for transgender athletes to compete.\n\n“We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play,” the NZOC said.\n\n“The New Zealand team is committed to supporting all eligible New Zealand athletes at the Olympic Games, ensuring their mental and physical wellbeing as they compete on the world stage.” Earlier Monday, Wang Zhouyu won the women’s 87-kilogram category for the first of China’s two weightlifting gold medals of the day. Wang won with a total of 270 kilograms. Tamara Salazar won the silver for Ecuador with a total 263, and Crismery Santana took the bronze with 256 for the Dominican Republic.",

Dean, who joined the Fort Worth Police Department in April 2018, resigned two days after the shooting and just hours before being arrested and charged with murder.According to Dean's original arrest affidavit, Jefferson was inside a bedroom playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew moments before the shooting.

Closing them is out of the question, officials said.\n\n“Suppose if we closed the border — these people would have come in big numbers (with the help of) human traffickers via illegal routes that would have caused far more positive cases, danger and deaths in Afghanistan,” Waheed Mayar, a Public Health Ministry spokesman, told Arab News.\n\nThe main official crossing point leads to the Herat province in western Afghanistan, which has become the area worst affected by COVID-19.\n\nJavid said authorities, for their part, had increased preventive measures which include checking all returnees and isolating those affected by the virus.\n\n“We have increased precautionary measures along the border with Iran to fight the spread of COVID-19, but the main challenge is the illegal crossings. We are assessing the situation closely and will make new decisions as things evolve in the coming days and weeks,” he told Arab News.\n\nAs an additional measure, authorities have extended the lockdown in Herat by three more weeks, with Monday being the third day since the curfew was enforced in Kabul, too.\n\nThe move, however, has failed to allay the fears of residents who said they were worried about their future.\n\n“We are concerned about the spread of the virus. We know it is a global issue, which came from China to Iran and from there to here … These Afghans went to Iran for survival or economic needs. Now, they are fleeing Iran for Afghanistan to remain alive and do not know if they are contaminated,” Fateh Shah, a shopkeeper in Kabul, said, adding: “All we can do is to pray and take measures not to get affected.”",

    "content": "My driver in Oakland last week told me about a billboard. A lot of people in town—sorry, The Town—were talking about it. This was before Game 3. It had a picture of Kawhi Leonard and a message stamped on it: “The King of the North is Coming.” The driver snickered. She was a Warriors fan and thought it was cute that the North was bothering to make the trip at all. She’s probably not so amused anymore.\n\nThe North came. The North conquered. The North went up 3-1 in the NBA Finals, and then stuck around on Friday evening to party after what might have been the Golden State Warriors’ final home game at Oracle Arena.What a wild scene. A lot of Warriors fans—A. Lot. Of. Warriors. Fans—left Game 4 early. It was a total Toronto takeover from the crowd to the court. But while Raptors fans that made the trip to Oakland sang and celebrated, the actual Raptors hardly showed any emotion at all.That is the kind of reaction you’d expect after winning regular-season game no. 47 in Orlando, not Game 4 of the NBA Finals in Oakland. The Raptors are terrifying. If the Warriors weren’t scared of them before, they should be well and fully frightened now.\n\nNot many people outside Canada probably thought this was possible—and maybe not that many people in Canada, either. The Raptors are the 35th team in NBA history to take a 3-1 lead in the Finals. Only one team has been in that position and lost: the 2016 Warriors. The odds are very much in Toronto’s favor now and very much not in Golden State’s.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for that. Kawhi Leonard—who had his 14th 30-point performance of the playoffs in Game 4, joining Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James as the only players to clear that benchmark, per NBA.com/Stats—has been astonishing us all postseason. His supporting cast of Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, Marc Gasol, and Danny Green has taken turns helping him out in various games. Meanwhile, Steph Curry’s best Finals performance came in a Game 3 loss at home. The Warriors haven’t been able to find the extra juice they need, and their big guys—especially Boogie Cousins—have been pretty consistently outplayed by Toronto’s bigs. Kevin Durant still hasn’t put on his uniform and taken to the court, though he was finally cleared to practice on Sunday. A lot of things have gone right for the Raptors, while not much has for the Warriors. And now here we are, one win away from the first NBA parade north of the wall.Game 4 was obviously pivotal. If the Raptors had lost and the series was tied going back to Toronto, Nick Nurse’s guys would probably start sweating. The Warriors are the defending champs, after all, and their muscle memory has gotten them out of a lot of dodgy situations during this run of five consecutive championship appearances. That the Raptors pulled out that victory, on the road, in what might have been Oracle Arena’s farewell, was an incredible accomplishment. Toronto applied maximum pressure and the Warriors buckled. It was a massive moment for the Raptors, and like so many others that came before it this postseason, they carpe’d the hell out of that diem.\n\nBefore Game 4, Nurse said all games in the Finals are “critical,” but Friday’s proceedings seemed especially so. One more win. That’s all the Raptors need now. Nurse joked about that and said “you can’t win four until you win three, I think, if my math is good there.” His math was good there—but I still can’t believe how it’s adding up. I kept counting the Raptors out throughout the playoffs—and throughout the playoffs they responded with inspired play. Early in the series, Golden State insisted the Warriors only worry about the Warriors. I bought into that narrative as much as they did. It was obviously foolish to write off these Finals as some sort of existential internal struggle for the Warriors when the Raptors have been the better team and the better story all along. At some point, we really should believe our lying eyes. The Raptors and Warriors have played six times this season. Toronto has won five of those six. The teams have played 16 quarters during this series. The Raptors have won 13 of those 16. If not for that 18-0 third-quarter run in Game 2, the Warriors might already be on summer vacation. This isn’t an accident or a fluke. This is real. This is happening.\n\nWe should have known. I should have known. The Raptors have been trying to tell us all postseason.Not many people saw this coming. Before the season began, FiveThirtyEight’s model gave the Raptors a 12 percent shot to win the NBA title. Midway through the season in January, those chances were only slightly better at 15 percent. When the Finals began, Vegas oddsmakers had the Warriors as the heavy favorite. Not anymore. FiveThirtyEight gives Golden State just an 11 percent shot to recover from the wounds the Raptors have inflicted and win the series. On Friday night, Steph Curry called it “not a good feeling right now.” Draymond Green went further: “This sucks … Yeah, it sucks. A lot.”\n\nIf it’s any consolation, the Warriors aren’t the only ones to experience that uneasy, shell-shocked sensation this postseason. The Raptors did the same thing to the three teams they faced before Golden State. Just as Kawhi has been inarguably the best player in the playoffs, the Raptors have been the best team—even when they started slowly or stumbled along the way. Someone asked Nurse about that in Oakland last week and wanted to know whether the head coach could pinpoint the moment when the Raptors “flipped the switch” against the Warriors. Nurse rejected the premise. He said he didn’t think there was any flipping in the Finals. If anything, Nurse said, Toronto “flipped a switch about Game 2 against Orlando.”That first game in the first round was one of the worst for the Raptors all postseason—or all season, full stop, no prefix needed. They were dreadful. D.J. Augustin scored 25 points against Toronto in Game 1—which was exactly as many as Kawhi had that evening and 25 more than Kyle Lowry mustered. Magic fans gloated. That’s the same Orlando organization that sadly trumpeted Shelvin Mack only a year before.\n\nIt felt like Toronto was doomed to suffer another postseason indignity and get bounced out of the playoffs earlier than it wanted. Again. Except this time it would have been way worse considering LeBron James wasn’t doing the bouncing. Not to mention that Masai Ujiri gambled big when he traded for Leonard and later upgraded the roster with Marc Gasol. Crapping out against the Magic in the first round would have been a truly bad beat. Instead, the Raptors stomped Orlando and won the next four games by an average of nearly 19 points while Leonard got cooking (he averaged 27.8 points, 6.6 rebounds, three assists, and 1.2 steals against the Magic on 56.6 percent shooting from the floor and 50 percent from 3).\n\nThat wasn’t the first time I doubted the Raptors’ resolve. Or the last. When the Sixers went up 2-1 in the second round, it felt like Philly—which kept boasting about having the best starting five east of Oakland—was marching toward the conference finals. Then Leonard went supernova in Game 4 to even the proceedings (he played 43 minutes and scored 39 points on just 20 shots). And then we all know what happened in Game 7.I was in Toronto for all four of those bounces. It feels like the ball is still up there tap dancing on the rim. Given what we know now about this Raptors run, of course that shot fell for Leonard. It had to. There was no other possible outcome.\n\nBut Milwaukee. Milwaukee was when I was absolutely certain everything would come apart for Toronto. It was a nice postseason for the Raptors but it couldn’t be a great one. I was sure of it—especially after the Bucks beat them in the first two games. After that it was so clear who the better team was that I texted some of my NBA reporter pals about all the beers we would drink in Milwaukee and all the cheese curds that would clog our arteries. Instead, it was off to Toronto for Molson and poutine after the Raptors rattled off four wins in a row—including an incredible double-overtime Game 3 performance in which Leonard and Siakam combined to play 103 minutes and score more than half of the team’s 118 points.\n\nThere have been so many impressive, feel-good moments for the Raptors this postseason—including and especially that first NBA Finals game in Canada, which I watched with a few hundred new friends who are probably still partying. This run seems even more unbelievable when you consider that Toronto’s main group hadn’t played much together. Entering the playoffs, the starting lineup of Lowry, Siakam, Leonard, Gasol, and Green logged just 161 regular-season minutes in 14 games, according to NBA.com/Stats. That is not a lot to go on. The Raptors have solved the postseason puzzle on the fly. Nurse said after his guys lost the first two games in Milwaukee that they weren’t “upset or bothered or worried.” To their mind, they thought they won “six of the eight quarters” but “didn’t have anything to show for it.” They figured if they fixed a few things and made some adjustments and just kept at it, they’d course correct when everyone else expected them to veer off the postseason path. That’s been a theme for them throughout the playoffs. Now, with what is unquestionably the biggest game in franchise history on Monday evening in Toronto, the Raptors have exactly what they and Nurse wanted: something to show for all that effort.\n\nBack in Oakland, long after Game 4 ended and the final note of “O Canada” had been sung in a wonderful, impromptu karaoke session, I saw Kyle Lowry pause on his way out of Oracle Arena to take a selfie with a young fan who had stayed behind. The boy was maybe 10 or 12, and he seemed overjoyed that Lowry stopped. He wasn’t one of the merry members of traveling Toronto fans, though. The kid was wearing a Warriors jersey. He leaned into the picture with Lowry and smiled wide. It was a hell of a snapshot on a remarkable season, and the kid should be forgiven by his fellow Warriors loyalists for momentarily breaking ranks. The boy isn’t alone, after all. The Raptors have captured all of our attention.",

It’s going to take more than this to stop us from serving and trusting God,\" Watley said. \"His steadfast love endures!”\n\nHe quickly added: “You do your part. You wash your hands like you got sense.”The unique opportunity offered many churches a chance to broaden their audience.\n\n\"Over 300 salvations through Woodlands Church’s online services this weekend,\" Christian author Lee Strobel tweeted. \"Thank God! Praying that this medical crisis sparks a revival!\"Religious leaders took unprecedented action over the weekend to accommodate the faithful.\n\nFor Roman Catholics, where attendance at Mass is considered a sacred obligation, many bishops -- including all those in Pennsylvania and Ohio — said they were temporarily dispensing with the requirement that parishioners attend Mass.“A general dispensation is given from the Sunday and Holy Day obligation,” the Utah bishop, Oscar Solis, announced. ”Catholics are asked to pray at home, with the rosary, biblical prayer, personal devotions and/or to devoutly watch televised Masses.\"\n\nComparably strong measures were taken by leaders of many other faiths, ranging from Orthodox Jewish rabbis in New Jersey to Episcopal and United Methodist bishops in North Carolina.\n\nFrom its headquarters in Salt Lake City, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church, announced it is halting all worship services and church activities for its 16 million members worldwide.\n\nHoly Week will look very different for millions of Christians across the globe.The Vatican has already announced all public Masses in Italy are forbidden, and with Easter, April 12, quickly approaching, it appears the measures put in place by the Italian government could extend beyond April 3.\n\nPope Francis left the Vatican Sunday to visit St. Mary Major Basilica near Rome's central train station, where he reportedly prayed to the Virgin Mary for the sick.More than 6,470 people worldwide have died in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with at least 64 in the United States.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.",

It was interesting to see how similar his efforts in NASCAR Cup and IMSA were to ours.\n\n“We have talked ever since that event and we are excited to welcome Rick Ware Racing into our family at DCR.”\n\nThe primary sponsor of the #51 car will be announced in February with the driver of that season-long entry expected to be announced next week.\n\nEx-Formula 1 driver Romain Grosjean is favorite for the seat, although his participation in IndyCar’s four oval races remains open to question.\n\nShould he choose not to compete in the Texas double-header and the race at Gateway, a driver such as JR Hildebrand could be drafted in, although the Californian wouldn’t be available for the Indy 500 as he is due to take his ‘regular’ ride with Dreyer & Reinbold Racing.\n\nSaid Ware: “I met Dale last year through our Indy efforts with David Byrd and struck up a friendship with him and his team. I have thought a long time about expanding into IndyCar from our efforts in NASCAR Cup, Xfinity and IMSA, so this collaboration was an easy and logical step. We look forward to a competitive 2021 and beyond together.”\n\nRick Ware Racing (RWR) currently fields four charters in the NASCAR Cup Series; No. 15, 51, 52 and 53. Located in Mooresville, North Carolina, RWR has competed within NASCAR's top touring series since 2000. Over the past 20 years, RWR has competed in the Super Trofeo Series, IMSA, Asian Le Mans Series, ARCA and several other smaller series.\n\nHis RWR Eurasia entry will compete in the LMP2 class at this weekend’s Rolex 24 Hours at Daytona.",

An ultra-speed motorbike racer, he achieved numerous land speed records for motorbike and car,\" the group said.\n\"Over the past decade, Zef amassed over 70 British, World, UKTA, ACU and Guinness speed records with bikes, cars, and quads.

Last night's attack on Ganja was the second of its kind throughout the ongoing clashes between the forces of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The city was first hit on October 4. Ganja's population is over 500,000 and the city is located about 60 kilometers far from the battlefield in Azerbaijan's occupied territories.Hajiyev added that the same attack was committed on the Mingachevir city of Azerbaijan, as well. The city was hit by Smerch heavy multiple rocket launcher which was received by Armenia during the humanitarian ceasefire period. Atantis Armenian Airlines transported the missiles and missile system onboard civilian aircraft to Armenia, according to Hajiyev.\n\n“Within the framework of humanitarian aid, the corrupt air carrier Atlantis Armenian Airlines, which is under sanctions, is transporting missiles and missile systems to Armenia on civil aircraft. This is a flagrant violation of the Chicago Convention and the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization,” he wrote in his Twitter account.\n\nMingachevir, Azerbaijan's fourth most populated city, is home to the country's largest water dam. Consequences of a possible strike on the Mingachevir reservoir could be catastrophic for Azerbaijan and the entire region. Officials at the National Center of Environmental Forecasting insist that water from the dam could inundate a huge territory in Azerbaijan stretching from the country's central part toward east up to capital Baku over 240 kilometers. Such damage could lead to environmental, infrastructure and humanitarian disasters, which could kill countless civilians.\n\nThe latest clashes are the longest and fiercest fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan since the countries reached the ceasefire in 1994. The skirmishes along the Line of Contact in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan erupted on September 27 after Armenia's troops began shelling military and civilian positions of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani forces took immediate counter-attack measures to repel the offensive. The fighting quickly escalated as both sides have intensively deployed artillery, UAVs, mechanized forces, and infantry along the frontline.\n\nAs of Saturday, Armenian authorities confirmed the deaths of 405 servicemen. However, the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan said 2,300 servicemen of Armenia have been killed or wounded. Azerbaijan has not revealed the total number of military losses. With the death toll of the recent attack on Ganja, the overall number of civilian casualties reached 40 in Azerbaijan along with over 200 injured residents.\n\nThe Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which is over 30 years old, is one of the main threats to peace and stability in South Caucasus. The roots of the conflict stem from the rise of anti-Azerbaijan sentiments in Armenia in 1988 due to Yerevan's illegal claims for internationally recognized Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.\n\nFollowing the Soviet Union’s dissolution in 1991, Armenia launched a military campaign against Azerbaijan that lasted until a ceasefire deal was reached in 1994. Armenia occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized territories including the Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven surrounding districts. One million ethnic Azerbaijanis were forcibly displaced from these areas and 30,000 were killed.\n\nArmenia continues to defy fulfilling four UN Security Council resolutions on the withdrawal of its occupying forces from Azerbaijani lands and return of internally displaced Azerbaijanis to their native land.",

The 'big four' (France, Germany, Italy, UK) have no problem, but it is harder for the likes of Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\n\"We want to hear from innovative people who've got a clever idea that doesn't need a billion or half a billion euros, but can be done with a much smaller amount.\"\n\nInterested parties will have to move fast, however. Expressions of interest must be submitted by 23 March, followed by a defined proposal in June.\n\nA clutch of the best ideas will probably be selected for study in November, with a winner chosen for implementation 12 months after that.\n\nThere is no directive on what an S-Class mission should do, other than it fit within Esa's \"Cosmic Vision\" - the strategy document that governs all the agency's space science endeavours and which covers fundamental, but fairly broad, themes about the Universe and our place within it.\nAlthough Esa will be contributing 50m euros, the national governments of winning scientists will almost certainly be backing the projects as well, perhaps funding the cost of instrument development.\n\nEven so, the \"fast and small\" nature of the S-Class philosophy means it is unlikely that we will see highly sophisticated and complex projects such as deep-space probes or Mars landers.\n\nMore realistic mission concepts could include compact space telescopes to look at very particular phenomena in the sky, or perhaps fundamental physics experiments that need to be done in the weightless environment of Earth orbit.\n\nA good example might be the 8m-euro Lares (Laser Relativity Satellite) spacecraft launched in February on Esa's new Vega rocket.\n\nThis 37cm-diameter sphere developed by the Italian space agency (Asi) looks akin to a hi-tech \"disco ball\". It features 92 reflectors on its surface and is being used to make very precise laser ranging measurements from Earth.\n\nIts purpose is to study \"frame-dragging\", one consequence of general relativity that describes how the Earth twists local space-time around with it as it rotates.\n\nAnother example is Esa's own Proba-2 satellite. This small platform was sent up principally to test new space technologies, but it incorporates an imager from Belgium calledSwapthat is taking scientifically very useful pictures of the Sun.\n\nSwap was in action last week, tracking the solar storm that hurled billions of tonnes of plasma at Earth.\n\nIn complete contrast, Esa is about to select its next large, or \"L-Class\", mission.\n\nThree ideas are competing: a big X-ray telescope, a probe to Jupiter and its moons, and another - but much grander - general relativity experiment to detect gravitational waves. The total cost of the winning concept is likely to be in the region of a billion euros.",

    "content": "The opioid crisis just keeps getting worse, in part because new types of drugs keep finding their way onto the streets. Fentanyl, heroin’s synthetic cousin, is among the worst offenders.\n\nIt’s deadly because it’s so much stronger than heroin, as shown by the photograph above, which was taken at the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory. On the left is a lethal dose of heroin, equivalent to about 30 milligrams; on the right is a 3-milligram dose of fentanyl, enough to kill an average-sized adult male.\n\nFentanyl, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is up to 100 times more potent than morphine and many times that of heroin.Drugs users generally don’t know when their heroin is laced with fentanyl, so when they inject their usual quantity of heroin, they can inadvertently take a deadly dose of the substance. In addition, while dealers try to include fentanyl to improve potency, their measuring equipment usually isn’t fine-tuned enough to ensure they stay below the levels that could cause users to overdose. Plus, the fentanyl sold on the street is almost always made in a clandestine lab; it is less pure than the pharmaceutical version and thus its effect on the body can be more unpredictable.\n\nHeroin and fentanyl look identical, and with drugs purchased on the street, “you don’t know what you’re taking,” Tim Pifer, the director of the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory, told STAT in an interview. “You’re injecting yourself with a loaded gun.”New Hampshire, like the rest of New England, has been particularly hard hit by the opioid epidemic. The state saw a total of 439 drug overdoses in 2015; most were related to opioids, and about 70 percent of these opioid-related deaths involved fentanyl. The state has seen 200 deadly opioid overdoses this year so far, said Pifer.\n\nFentanyl was originally used as an anesthetic. Then doctors realized how effective it was at relieving pain in small quantities and started using it for that purpose. In the hands of trained professionals — and with laboratory-grade equipment — fentanyl actually has a pretty wide therapeutic index, or range within which the drug is both effective and safe.\n\nThe difference in strength between heroin and fentanyl arises from differences in their chemical structures. The chemicals in both bind to the mu opioid receptor in the brain. But fentanyl gets there faster than morphine — the almost-instantaneous byproduct when the body breaks down heroin — because it more easily passes through the fat that is plentiful in the brain. Fentanyl also hugs the receptor so tightly that a tiny amount is enough to start the molecular chain of events that instigates opioids’ effects on the body.",

    "content": "A video published Thursday appeared to show how the Houston Astros stole signs during the 2017 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers and identified the signals the Astros allegedly used to alert batters that a certain type of pitch was coming.\n\nA Twitter user shared a video of the Astros’ alleged sign-stealing during the World Series. The video claims that the Astros used two different whistling noises to signal to batters that a fastball or a breaking ball was about to be pitched.\n\nThe video broke down at-bats from Josh Reddick, George Springer, Evan Gattis, Yuli Gurriel and Jose Altuve during the World Series. There didn’t appear to be a ton of crowd noise during the at-bats either.\nThe Astros have come under intense scrutiny after former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers and other unnamed sources, revealed to The Athletic that the team used a sophisticated system to steal signs given by an opposing team’s catcher to his pitcher. Houston allegedly had a camera set up in centerfield which was hooked up to a monitor in the clubhouse, and when a sign for an off-speed pitch was given, a team employee would relay the message to a hitter with loud banging in the dugout.\n\nTwo sources told The Athletic that the sign-stealing extended into the postseason in 2017, but another denied it went on that long.\n\nThe Astros may have tipped their own hand in the matter as well. A 2017 DVD commemorating their first World Series championship showed a table, chairs and a TV in the clubhouse which appeared to be the area where a team employee would alert batters to an upcoming pitch.On Sunday, the Twitter user known as Jomboy – who already uncovered peculiar noises coming from the Astros dugout on off-speed pitches – again brought to light the team’s alleged cheating setup.\n\nVideo from the team’s championship DVD allegedly shows where the Astros employees would tip batters. Carlos Correa comes down from the dugout and to his right you can see a trash can, a table, a few chairs and a cable. The setup is still there when Alex Bregman runs through as well.MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday an investigation was underway.\n\n“That investigation is going to encompass not only what we know about ‘17, but also ‘18 and ’19,” he said. “To the extent we are talking to people all over the industry, former employees, competitors, whatever. To the extent that we find other leads, we're going to follow these leads.”\n\nManfred said the Astros were the only team being investigated for now.“Our clubs, all 30 of them, recognize that the integrity of the competition on the field is crucial to what we do every day,” he said. “I think that there's wide support across the industry for the idea that when we have a problem in this area, there should be firm, serious disciplinary action that discourages people from engaging in this type of behavior.”\n\nAstros owner Jim Crane declined to comment on the allegations when he was seen Wednesday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The aircraft had on board two police officers and a civilian pilot at the time. Eyewitnesses described badly injured people at the scene.\n\nAs Saturday morning broke in Glasgow, Scottish police said 32 people had been taken to hospitals across the city including the Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Western Infirmary. Rescue crews and medical teams were continuing to recover others from the scene.\n\nScotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, said on Twitter: \"We must all prepare ourselves for the likelihood of fatalities. I can confirm that it is a police helicopter which has been involved in the tragic accident in Glasgow. Rescue efforts in full operation. Given an incident of this scale we must all prepare ourselves for the likelihood of fatalities.\"\n\nA spokesman for Police Scotland said: \"A major incident has been declared after the Eurocopter EC135 T2 – with a crew of three consisting of two police officers and a civilian pilot – came down on the roof of a pub in Stockwell Street at 10.25pm.\n\n\"Emergency services responded immediately and remain at the scene at the present time. Cordons have been put in place to allow the rescue operation to take place.\"In a briefing to media at the scene hours after the crash, Assistant Chief Officer Lewis Ramsay of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said his officers were still treating the incident as a rescue operation. \"We have dealt with numerous casualties ranging from walking wounded to people who have had to be assisted from the scene. Some have been treated at local hospitals. We are unable to confirm numbers at the moment.\n\n\"We have a crew in place working to stabilise the building and we've called on resources and colleagues from across Scotland including Dundee, Edinburgh and Falkirk. We have around 125 firefighters on the scene in total.\"\n\nJim Murphy, a Labour frontbench MP who was driving by and stopped to help, said members of the public formed a human chain to get people out of the building.\n\n\"What I saw was a pile of people clambering out of the pub, dust everywhere. People were covered in multiple injuries.\"\n\nWesley McEwan, 53, an electrician who was inside the bar at the time of the crash, said that in the moments after the helicopter came through the roof he could see two people inside the cockpit through the shattered windscreen, as well as injured people all around.\n\n\"I was in the bar having a few drinks and there was an explosion – it wasn't an explosion but that's what it sounded like. And we were completely stunned for about 20 seconds.\"\n\nMcEwan said the helicopter came down between the bar and the stage. \"I think there were about three people, I could see people trapped under it. They were unconscious. And all around bits of debris had flown. There were people bleeding everywhere.\"\n\nGrace MacLean, who was inside the pub at the time, told the BBC: \"It was fairly busy. We were having a nice time and then there was just a whoosh noise. There was no bang, no explosion.\n\n\"We were all joking that the band had caused the roof to come down. They carried on playing at first.\"\"Then it [the roof] started to come down and people were screaming. It's a real testament to the people of Glasgow, people were saying: 'there's the door, come outside'. Then people started to come out with injuries and blood. It was only when the paramedics came out and said there's a helicopter on top that I looked up and saw the metal.\"\n\nWesley Shearer, a local man attending the gig tweeted a picture of the scene outside of the bar, adding: \"This is unbelievable. Just spent 20 minutes pulling people out the bar. Apparently a helicopter crashed on the roof.\"\n\nMinutes earlier, Shearer had tweeted: \"Holy fucking shit. The roof in the Clutha bar just collapsed mid gig. People have been caught under it, injuries + smoke everywhere.\"\n\nGordon Smart, the editor of the Scottish Sun, told the BBC that he was on the sixth floor of a nearby multi-storey car park when he heard what sounded like a misfiring engine, before looking up and seeing the helicopter falling from the sky.\n\nHe added: \"It was just such a surreal moment. It looked like it was dropping from a great height at a great speed. I'm about 80% sure that it was a police helicopter.\n\n\"There was no fire ball and I did not hear an explosion. It fell like a stone. The engine seemed to be spluttering.\"Photographs taken at the scene showed what appeared to be debris containing police markings, while other images showed wreckage with fluorescent markets that resembled a helicopter used by Strathclyde police's airport unit.\n\nPolice quickly threw up a cordon in the streets surrounding the incident, which occurred metres from the riverside in a district close to Glasgow's main shopping centre. Dozens of people who were caught up in the incident were later taken to a nearby Holiday Inn hotel.\n\nAccording to their Facebook page and the Facebook page of the bar, a nine-piece Glasgow ska band called Esperanza were playing at the venue at the time of the incident.\n\nPolice Scotland Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick, delivering a prepared statement in the early hours of Saturday morning at the scene of the \"terrible incident\", said crews had \"responded so professionally in such difficult circumstances\".\n\n\"At 10.25pm yesterday evening the Police Scotland helicopter – a Eurocopter EC135 T2 – came down on the roof of the Clutha Vaults pub in Stockwell Street, Glasgow.\n\n\"There were three people on board – two police officers and a civilian pilot. There were a number of customers inside the bar at the time.\n\n\"We are co-ordinating the operation with colleagues from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Scottish Ambulance Service, who are working to make the scene safe and recover people from the scene.\n\n\"That rescue operation is clearly ongoing. It is too early at this stage to provide any details around why the helicopter came down.\n\n\"A full investigation has already begun and this is being carried out jointly between Police Scotland and the Air Accident Investigation Branch, under the direction of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\n\n\"Police Scotland, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and the Scottish Ambulance Service are currently fully engaged in the operation.\n\n\"Specialist teams from fire and ambulance services are on the scene. Work is ongoing to make the building safe.\n\n\"We are also working closely with partners in the local health service and local authority.\"",

The only way out of the current political impasse seems to be the adoption of a conciliatory attitude by all parties concerned. This, however, seems to be only a remote possibility, given a governing party whose democratic credentials are now in question, an opposition that provides no credible alternative policy to the political and economic ills of the country, and a judiciary that has still not fully purged itself of the entrenched beliefs and attitudes of the state bureaucracy.",

    "content": "Pittsburgh's men's basketball and football programs have been placed on three years' probation and former basketball coach Kevin Stallings received a three-year show-cause order as part of a series of violations announced by the Division I Committee on Infractions on Thursday.\n\nStallings is not referenced by name in the report, but the violations agreement -- covering a period from August 2015 to March 2018 -- said Pitt's former basketball coach instructed and allowed three non-coaching staff members to perform coaching duties, which exceeded the number of permissible coaches on staff.\n\nPitt had self-reported the violation prior to the NCAA launching its investigation.\n\n\"Pitt Athletics is steadfastly committed to integrity and NCAA rules compliance,\" athletic director Heather Lyke said in a statement Thursday. \"A reflection of that strong commitment is the fact that, upon discovering these violations, we immediately provided a self-report to the NCAA and began a cooperative and thorough review. While disappointed in the violations, I am confident that our already-strong culture of compliance will help each of our programs avoid such situations in the future.\"\n\nStallings also developed an alert system to ensure the non-permissible coaches would not get caught and ordered the deletion of video to prevent Pitt administration from confirming the violations, according to the report.\n\nDespite being warned by administrators within the athletic department, Stallings did not cease the violations and was determined that he failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance while at Pitt.\n\nUnder the show-cause order, if Stallings is hired within that time span by a member school, he must be suspended from 30% of the first season of employment.\n\nThe report also states that Pitt's former director of basketball operations produced personalized recruiting videos for 12 prospects to watch while visiting the school and later refused to participate in an enforcement interview about his involvement with the activities while on staff at Pitt.\n\nIn addition, football coach Pat Narduzzi was found to have been present at a football practice when three former quality control staff members performed coaching duties, which also exceeded the number of permissible coaches. The violation went undetected in part because the football program used a system to play music when outside parties were present at practice, triggering the quality control staffers to stay clear of the student-athletes.\n\nNarduzzi was handed a show-cause order that will withhold him from two days of team practice in August.\n\n\"As head coach of the University of Pittsburgh football program, I am wholeheartedly committed to following NCAA rules and preventing these types of issues from happening again,\" Narduzzi said in a statement released by the university. \"I fully recognize my responsibility in what occurred and, equally important, how those missteps will be corrected as we proceed forward.\"\n\nAlong with the probation and Stallings' punishment, Pitt received a $5,000 fine from the men's basketball and football budgets and a three-year show-cause order for the former director of basketball operations.\n\nThe men's basketball program will also have a reduction in the number of countable coaches by one at a regular practice for 16 hours during the 2019-20 academic year, while the football program will have a reduction of one countable coach for four days of practice, and two quality control staff members must be removed from practice for three days.",

    "content": "The Australian Grand Prix has been called off because of coronavirus. In what had increasingly looked to be an inevitable decision, the demise of the race was drawn out, painful and undignified.\n\nFrom the moment the first McLaren team member was identified as having the coronavirus on Thursday evening, rumour and counter-rumour flew around Melbourne but from F1 management and Formula One’s governing body, the FIA, the silence was as baffling as it was deafening.\n\nThe governing bodies finally broke cover almost 12 hours after McLaren announced they were withdrawing from the grand prix on Thursday, after one of their team members was diagnosed with the coronavirus. The FIA and F1 issued a joint statement with the race organisers the Australian Grand Prix corporation.It read: “Following the confirmation that a member of the McLaren Racing Team has tested positive for Covid-19 and the team’s decision to withdraw from the Australian Grand Prix, the FIA and Formula 1 convened a meeting of the other nine team principals on Thursday evening.\n\n“Those discussions concluded with a majority view of the teams that the race should not go ahead. The FIA and Formula 1, with the full support of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, have therefore taken the decision that all Formula 1 activity for the Australian Grand Prix is cancelled.”\n\n“We appreciate this is very disappointing news for the thousands of fans due to attend the race and all ticket holders will receive a full refund.”\n\nThe decision, which many had felt was long overdue, was pre-empted by an announcement from world champions Mercedes that they would be withdrawing from the event.\n\n“The Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team has today sent a letter to the FIA and F1 requesting the cancellation of the 2020 Australian Grand Prix,” it read. “We share the disappointment of the sport’s fans that this race cannot go ahead as planned.\n\n“However, the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our team members and of the wider F1 community are our absolute priority. In light of the force majeure events we are experiencing with regards to the Coronavirus pandemic, we no longer feel the safety of our employees can be guaranteed if we continue to take part in the event.”\n\nShortly after the announcement, Ferrari issued a statement supporting the decision to cancel the race. Suggestions that the race was off had been circulating throughout the night. However initially the organisers issued a statement claiming the event would go on as planned and hospitality staff were told to attend.There were reports that F1 staff were being told to treat the day as normal. Marshals were in place on the circuit and a two-seater car was doing laps. However, requests for information from the authorities, organisers and teams yielded nothing.\n\nFans arriving found they were not allowed to enter the track while only members of five teams turned up at the paddock. Further confusion was spread when Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews said on Friday morning that the if the race was to be held, it would have to do so behind closed doors. Yet at this point it is understood that at least two drivers, Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel, had already flown home.\n\nWith no official statements forthcoming, fans in large numbers were already gathering to enter Albert Park but being refused entry by staff with little or no information to guide them.\n\nNo explanation has been given for why the decision to finally close down the race took so long, or why so little information was disseminated in the interim. It appears possible that reaching agreement on who was to take responsibility for the cancellation – between state authorities, organisers, the FIA and F1 – may have contributed to the longevity of the process.\n\nOn Thursday, Lewis Hamilton had earlier heaped pressure on the fate of the grand prix by claiming they were putting lives in danger with 300,000 fans expected through the gates of Albert Park over the next few days. “I am really very, very surprised that we are here,” the six-times champion said. “I think it’s really shocking that we are all sitting in this room. It’s a concern I think for the people here – it’s quite a big circus that’s come here and it’s definitely concerning for me.”A few hours later McLaren confirmed that a member of their team had tested positive for coronavirus. The individual was one of eight F1 personnel who were tested for coronavirus on Wednesday but the only one confirmed to have the disease. The other seven results, including four team members from Haas who had shown symptoms, all returned negative.\n\nBefore the test results had returned the deputy chief health officer for Victoria, Annaliese van Diemen, had stated if any were to return positive results, their close contacts would be placed into “immediate quarantine”. This would have had a huge impact on the ability of any team to function.\n\nThe cancellation of the opening race of the season could have major repercussions for the sport’s immediate future. Next weekend’s Bahrain Grand Prix, which was already set to be staged behind closed doors, now looks unlikely to take place, particularly with F1 personnel in quarantine.\n\nThe inaugural race in Vietnam, scheduled for 5 April, is also under major threat. Following the postponement of the Chinese Grand Prix, the season could now start in the Netherlands on 3 May, but that is also subject to change.",

Plans for the protests in Washington DC that ended in the storming of the Capitol this week were widely shared on Parler.The actions by the two Silicon Valley companies mean that Parler could become unavailable for new downloads on the world’s main mobile phone app stores within a day. It would still be available in mobile browsers.\n\nParler’s chief executive, John Matze, said in posts on his service on Friday that Apple was applying standards to Parler that it did not apply to itself and the companies were attacking civil liberties. He added in a text message to Reuters: “Coordinating riots, violence and rebellions has no place on social media.”\n\nRight-leaning social media users in the United States have flocked to Parler, messaging app Telegram and the social site Gab, citing the more aggressive policing of political comments on mainstream platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.In suspending the service, Google, whose software powers Android phones, cited its policy against apps that promote violence and gave recent examples from Parler, including a Friday post that began: “How do we take back our country? About 20 or so coordinated hits” and another promoting a “Million Militia March” on Washington.\n\nIn a statement, Google said that “for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app*s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues”.\n\nIn a letter from Apple’s App Store review team to Parler seen, Apple cited participants of the mob storming the US Capitol building on Wednesday.“Content that threatens the well-being of others or is intended to incite violence or other lawless acts has never been acceptable on the App Store,” Apple said in the letter.Apple gave Parler 24 hours to “remove all objectionable content from your app ... as well as any content referring to harm to people or attacks on government facilities now or at any future date”.\n\nThe company also demanded that Parler submit a written plan “to moderate and filter this content” from the app.\n\nApple declined to comment.\n\nMatze, who describes himself as libertarian, founded Parler in 2018 as a “free-speech driven” alternative to mainstream platforms but began courting right-leaning users as prominent supporters of Trump moved there.Those who have joined include commentator Candace Owens, Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and rightwing activist Laura Loomer, who handcuffed herself to the door of Twitter’s New York office in 2018 to protest a ban on her by the site. In November, conservative activist Rebekah Mercer confirmed that the she and her family, which includes her father and hedge-fund investor Robert Mercer, have provided funding to Parler.\n\nMatze said of Apple: “Apparently they believe Parler is responsible for ALL user generated content on Parler. By the same logic, Apple must be responsible for ALL actions taken by their phones. Every car bomb, every illegal cell phone conversation, every illegal crime committed on an iPhone, Apple must also be responsible for.”",

Two gunmen killed 12 people there - an attack that Harpon reportedly described as \"well executed\".\n\nCharlie Hebdo lives on but 'in darkness'\nWhy known extremists can carry out terror attacks\nPolice colleagues had also commented on Harpon's changed behaviour towards women but, according to Paris police intelligence chief Françoise Bilancini, no concerns were formally reported.\"The alarm signals should have been enough to trigger an in-depth investigation, which is what we are doing now,\" Mr Castaner said. \"If a signal had appeared perhaps we could have prevented this happening.\"\n\nAbout 20 officers in the French security services have been taken off duty because of suspected Islamist radicalisation, he said, without giving details.\n\nMr Castaner brushed off calls for his resignation over the police \"failings\", saying he had not made any error in this case. But he pledged that \"we will tighten the net\" to pick up suspicious signs and rectify the \"malfunctioning\" alert system.Islamist background\nHarpon, a 45-year-old IT expert, had been working in the police intelligence unit since 2003. He had contact with members of the Salafist movement, anti-terrorist prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said, referring to the ultra-conservative Islamic ideology.\n\nOn Thursday morning, shortly before his attack, he exchanged 33 text messages with his wife. Mr Ricard said Harpon included religious phrases in his messages, such as \"Allahu akbar\" (God is greatest) and \"follow our much-loved Prophet Muhammad, and meditate on the Koran\".\n\nHis Moroccan-born wife was questioned by police but released from detention on Sunday evening. She reportedly told police that he had been incoherent and had heard voices the night before the attack.Anti-terror investigators took over the inquiry on Friday. It was initially regarded as a criminal matter.\n\nHarpon was shot dead on Thursday by a junior police officer after he attacked colleagues in several offices at the central police building.\n\nAccording to Mr Ricard, investigators established that Harpon left the building at lunchtime and bought two knives - one metal, the other ceramic - just half an hour before launching his attack.He stabbed three people inside two offices and two women on a stairway, before he was shot dead inside the building's courtyard. Three men and one woman were killed. A fifth person was seriously injured. Harpon slit the throat of one of the victims.\n\nThe police building is near major tourist sites including Notre-Dame Cathedral.",

    "content": "Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate is “the work to overcome the schisms in the Universal Orthodoxy, which were generated by the unlawful, anti-canonical and, I would say, senseless invasion of the Patriarch of Constantinople into Ukraine”, noted His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia on September 27, 2021, during the ceremony of presenting church awards to the DECR chairman, Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk and his vice-chairmen - Archbishop Leonid of Klin. Archpriest Nikolay Balashov, and Archimandrite Philaret (Bulekov). \n\n“I will dare say so because I know Patriarch Bartholomew only too well - probably, he was guided not by his own reason and not by his own will”, the Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church said. \n\nAt the same time, he rejected the allegations that, being under an external pressure, the Patriarch of Constantinople could not act otherwise: “And how did we managed to act otherwise when living in an atheistic state? You will not scare us by any campfire story, as we went through everything and did not stop communion with any Local Orthodox Church, which in our country were often called “henchmen of the American imperialism”. We maintained these relations, visited one another and invited their delegations to our country. Therefore, when we are told that today Patriarch Bartholomew ostensibly could not act otherwise, hinting at mighty outside forces, I do not accept this argument. Among Patriarchs of Constantinople, there were martyrs and confessors and one of them, Patriarch Gregorios, was hanged up on the Patriarchate’s gates. Constantinople has always been for us a stronghold of Orthodoxy”.\n\n“And we humanly very much upset by the fact that today the Patriarch of Constantinople has lapsed into schism because he took communion together with schismatics and recognized self-ordained clergy who do not have lawful consecration by canonical hierarchs”, His Holiness stated. \n\nAt the same time His Holiness stressed, “Aware of our truth, convinced that we stand on the unshakable foundation of holy canons, we should seek pastorally and humanly to overcome this difficult time in the inter-Orthodox relations, because in Greece, just as in other countries influenced by the Patriarch of Constantinople, there are our brothers and sisters, devoted monks and nuns, and it is a great sorrow for us that the mistakes of one make others suffer”. \n\nThere is a considerable work ahead to be done by the Department for External Church Relations: while sticking to the fundamental canonical attitude, to do all possible to help Universal Orthodoxy come out of the grave crisis in which it has found itself, noted the Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church. \n\nEach Local Orthodox Church has her own problems and very complicated ones, though not so visible as they were, for instance, for the Russian Church in the Soviet period, Patriarch Kirill recalled, emphasizing, “For this reason, our common solidarity and showing love for one another are very much important for strengthening Universal Orthodoxy”.",

If your music video features adult themes like sex or drug use, that video will likely not make it into Restricted Mode.”\n\nSome of the site’s biggest creators previously spoke out after their videos were censored.\n\nTyler Oakley, one of the site’s biggest names, said previously: “One of my recent videos “8 Black LGBTQ+ Trailblazers Who Inspire Me” is blocked because of this.”\n\nThe site explained previously: “Our system sometimes make mistakes in understanding context and nuances when it assesses which videos to make available in Restricted Mode.\n\n“For instance, the following videos are examples of where we got it wrong: Ash Hardell’s “Her Vows,” Calum McSwiggan’s “Coming Out To Grandma,” Jono and Ben’s “Woman interrupted during BBC interview,” and Tegan and Sara’s “BWU [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO].”\n\n“While the system will never be 100 percent perfect, we must and will do a better job.\n\n“There’s nothing more important to us than being a platform where anyone can belong, have a voice and speak out when they believe something needs to be changed. We truly appreciate your help keeping the YouTube community active and engaged on topics that matter to creators and YouTube fans alike.”",

    "content": "France, despite its reputation as a beacon of progressive liberalism, has been at the forefront of a burgeoning pan-European far-right movement.\n\nMarine Le Pen, an anti-immigration Eurosceptic who may well top the first round of France's presidential election on 23 April, is riding a populist insurgency that has been growing over the past 15 years.\n\nIts themes are familiar in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit: concern for hardworking people, support for traditional values, and opposition to immigration and supranational busybodies.\n\nBut the most distinctive characteristic of France's patriotic surge is youth. Unlike their contemporaries in the US and the UK, the under-30s in France are more nationalistic than the general population.\n\nAt the radical end of the movement are the \"identitaires\", or identitarians - the equivalent of the American alt-right.\n\nWho are the identitarians?\nTheir standard bearers are Génération Identitaire (GI), a group that specialises in publicity stunts that it films and posts online to advertise its fight to reclaim French territory said to have been lost to foreign migrants.GI has 120,000 Facebook fans - almost twice as many as the youth wings of the Socialist Party and the centre-right Republicans combined.\n\nUnlike the skinheads of old, the group sticks to non-violence. The iPhone, it has found, is mightier than the boot.Following a group of activists handing out flyers in Paris, however, it is clear that they relish verbal confrontation. Their leader Pierre Larti, 26, stands surrounded by a group of North African men.\n\n\"When I read this leaflet I understand that you don't want me here,\" one says.\n\n\"What we don't want is the replacement of our values by Islamic ones,\" replies Mr Larti. \"France is historically a Christian country. I'm not criticising anyone. What happens in your land is your business. What happens here is ours. We are against colonisation, and this is why we don't want the same phenomenon to happen in reverse.\"Oddly, perhaps, for a group passionately attached to national differences, GI is sprouting branches across Europe. But identitarians see the whole continent as a battleground between European and Islamic culture.\n\nJean-Yves Le Gallou, a former Euro-MP, speaks of a struggle for \"civilisational\" identity. \"Whether you are Dutch, German or French,\" he says, \"you have the same problem and have the same view of the world.\"\n\nMr Le Gallou, 69, has produced a video entitled Being European (\"Europe is not a globalised, borderless space. Europe is not African or Muslim territory.\") that has been viewed more than 3.2m times on YouTube in less than two years - three times as many as Being French, a sister video extolling his homeland.\n\nMr Le Gallou's website, Polemia, stands at the high-brow end of France's identitarian spectrum. In the 1970s, he was a leading member of the Nouvelle Droite, an influential group of far-right thinkers.\n\nHis continued influence is testament to the deep intellectual roots of the identitarian movement.\n\nIt also highlights the power of new media. Without the internet, Mr Le Gallou and others would have no mass audience. Their warnings against the \"Great Replacement\" of locals by immigrants are no-go areas for mainstream journalists.\n\nSpreading the message online\nShut out by traditional media, identitarians have thrived on the web over the past decade. One of the online stars is Fdesouche, a news aggregator that features links to articles and clips from mainstream sites selected to chronicle chaos in migrant suburbs.\n\nFdesouche offers no comment, but leaves readers to draw their own conclusions: Islamists and \"racaille\" (\"rabble\" - code for dark-skinned criminals) are threatening to take over the country, one housing estate at a time.\n\nFdesouche gets about 3m views per month, dwarfing the websites of mainstream politicians. Emmanuel Macron, a centrist with a devoted following of hipsters, manages less than 1m.Fdesouche's success has spawned a swarm of imitators and rivals.\n\nIs France's online far right a threat to democracy?\n\nOften collectively called the \"fachosphère\" (from \"fascist\"), websites denouncing mass immigration and Islam have seen spectacular growth in France over the past 10 years. And France's cyber-patriots are a diverse lot.One fault line divides new-model identitarians, who view Muslims as the main threat, from traditionalists who believe the chief malevolent force in the world is \"Zionism\".\n\nThe most prominent anti-Zionist is Alain Soral. His website, Égalité et Reconciliation (E&R), weaves nationalist and left-wing themes by calling for solidarity with people from poor countries.\n\nSoral rejects accusations of \"anti-Semitism\". He sees a clear distinction between \"ordinary Jews\" and what he calls the organised Jewish lobby, which he says is persecuting him.\n\nHe sympathises with native French people, but feels identitarians are focusing on the wrong target. By \"inciting poor whites to turn against blacks and Muslims\" they were doing the work of Zionists, he told the BBC.Alain Soral is regularly prosecuted for incitement. But he is no bit-part player. E&R has more readers than Fdesouche, and by some measures is France's most popular political website.\n\nVarious parts of the online alt-right may be firing from different directions, but their target is the same: the political and media establishment.\n\nSuch resentment is not the preserve of the identitarian fringe, or of people languishing in neglected provinces.\n\nOpposition to liberal elites and concern about the disappearance of borders are widespread, and increasingly being aired in the heart of Paris.\n\nAt Sciences Po, an institution that trains the next generation of government and business leaders. Eurosceptic students have set up a club, \"Critique of European Reason\" (CRE), to wage the fight where it matters.\n\nIts leader, Nicolas Pouvreau, says the group has managed to \"create a Eurosceptic safe space in an environment that remains hostile.\"\n\nAnother member, Sarah Knafo, says the rising popularity of Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) - France's largest party - has earned the group a grudging respect on campus: \"We represent something bigger than us, and people dare not despise us as much as they used to.\"\n\nLast year's Brexit vote in the UK thrilled CRE members. The next morning they gathered outside the UK embassy to drink champagne and sing God Save the Queen.\n\nAnti-white racism\nBeyond hostility to the EU, CRE members regard uncontrolled migration and trade flows as a source of social disintegration.\n\nIt would be wrong to label Critique of European Reason as far-right. The group brings together one-nation activists from both the left and the right who have much more in common with one another than with the moderates in their respective camps.Kevin, another CRE student who supports hard-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is as hostile to multiculturalism as the conservatives within the group.\n\nHaving lived in an immigrant banlieue (suburb) he says he has often been called \"dirty white\", and says the mainstream press denies the reality of \"anti-white racism\".\n\nUnfashionable as they are, these feelings are widespread among those who have left the banlieues.\n\n\"I have suffered from being white,\" says Ugo Iannuzzi, a Sorbonne student.\n\n\"I have often cried. I used to go to school with fear in my stomach. You start to feel bad about being white, about being French and loving your origins because you get beaten up, your phone gets stolen and glasses smashed.\"\n\nMr Iannuzzi supports the FN. But his resentment of the political and media elites mirrors that of left-wingers like Mr Vercin.\n\nLost generation\nAlexandre Devecchio, a journalist and author of a book on various tribes of young French rebels, calls all those preoccupied with the erosion of identity the \"Zemmour generation\". Eric Zemmour is an influential writer-broadcaster who argues that the 1968 revolt has led France to ruin.\n\nMany of today's twentysomethings, Mr Devecchio argues, agree with Zemmour because they feel let down. Born after the fall of the Berlin Wall, they were expected to blossom in an open, rainbow society within a pacified, post-historical Europe.\n\n\"For that generation, reality did not follow the script,\" Mr Devecchio told the BBC. What they have experienced is unemployment, insecure jobs, and a sense of physical and cultural insecurity in areas where radical Islam is on the rise, he believes.\n\nCould the identitarians and the wider Zemmour generation help Marine Le Pen win power?\n\nAt the moment that appears unlikely. Ms Le Pen lacks the backing of a major party, and is expected to be defeated by any second-round opponent.\n\nBut she can draw comfort from the fact that polls have underestimated the support of other populist leaders.\n\nHigh abstention levels could also help her. The instinct to rally around whoever runs against the FN is much weaker now than in the past. Polls suggest that half the voters backing hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon would either abstain or back Ms Le Pen in a second round against Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAnd should she lose the race, the setback could be temporary if her victorious opponent fails to bring about reform.\n\nIdentitarianism feeds on pessimism. The country's patriotic rebels are young and may have time on their side.",

The Islamic holy month of Ramadan begins around 23 April.\n\nThe traditional mass to celebrate Easter at the Basilica in Rome, followed by the pope’s Urbi et Orbi blessing in St Peter’s Square, is usually attended by tens of thousands of people from all over the world. But after the square was closed off by Italian police and public masses and funerals were cancelled, Easter celebrations are now in doubt.\n\nThe Vatican is livestreaming the pope’s daily 7am mass and the Angelus on Sundays. Despite the restrictions on movement in Italy, Francis – who has tested negative for the virus – has urged Catholic priests to “have the courage to go out and visit the sick … and to accompany the medical staff and volunteers in the work they do”.\n\nMost churches across the world have already advised congregants not to shake hands as a “sign of peace”, to ban sharing communion cups and placing wafers directly on the tongue, and to stop the practice of intinction, or dipping wafers in wine. But the risks of the virus spreading as a result of physical proximity could mean official bans on services of worship, or people deciding simply to stay at home.\n\nIn the UK, the Church of England has also advised against intinction and the placing of wafers directly on the tongue by those administering Eucharist. Physical contact – the “laying on of hands” – during blessings are suspended. It is considering issuing further guidance on elements of those traditional Holy Week and Easter services that could increase risk of transmission, such as the veneration of the cross.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox church, however, has refused to suspend the ritual of worshippers sipping from the same spoon during Holy Communion, saying: “This cannot be the cause of the spread of illness.” Critics have urged the church to listen to the advice of scientists.\n\nFor the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims, Ramadan is likely to present extra challenges. During the holy month, Muslims fast from dawn until sundown, but those with severe sickness, including flu, are permitted to break their fast.\n\nDuring Ramadan, mosque attendances usually peak, with people crammed against one another. Friday prayers have already been suspended across the Middle East as a result of the virus.Saudi Arabia has banned overseas visitors since the end of February, meaning those wishing to undertake pilgrimage to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina are unable to do so. About 12 million people usually visit Mecca each year, mostly for the hajj, which this year begins on 28 July. However, thousands wishing to perform umrah, a pilgrimage that can be undertaken at any time of year, have been affected by the ban.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has not advised any restrictions on gatherings but has warned that could change. “We would expect the mosque committee and scholars to show clear, decisive leadership and follow the public health advice, which may include considering the suspension of congregational prayers and events,” it said.\n\nJews wishing to visit relatives in Israel for the weeklong Passover holiday may find their entry to the country effectively barred. This week, the government ordered all those arriving in Israel from abroad – both Israeli citizens and others – to self-quarantine for 14 days, a ruling initially valid for two weeks, but which could be extended. Thousands of Christian pilgrims wishing to visit holy sites in Jerusalem at Easter may also be affected.\n\nThe Conference of European Rabbis has advised people not to kiss the Torah scroll, and Israel’s chief rabbi has said people should not touch or kiss mezuzahs affixed to door frames. Some US synagogues are cancelling all communal events, and others preparing to livestream services and offer online tuition for children preparing for barmitzvahs and batmitzvahs.\n\nMany Hindus taking part in celebrations of Holi, the festival of colours when coloured powder is thrown in the air and people paint each other’s faces, in India this week wore face masks as a precaution against coronavirus. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced he would not take part in public celebrations and advised people to avoid large gatherings.\n\nCelebrations for Rama Navami, a public holiday in India, which marks the birth of Lord Rama, attract thousands of devotees at places associated with him, such as Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh and Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu.\n\nGurdwaras are considering postponing events, including nagar kirtans – hymn-singing processions that can attract thousands of people – to mark Vaisakhi, according to City Sikhs, a UK organisation. The Vaisakhi nagar kirtan in Southall has been delayed until later in the year.",

    "content": "Legal scholar offers solutions to regulatory obstacles preventing businesses from using financial institutions.\n\nTweet\nShare\nPost\nEmail\nPrint\nLink\nFont Size:\nA A\nVaults, armed guards, and paranoia are costs of doing business today in the recreational marijuana industry. Because they have little access to banking, marijuana business owners must conduct their day-to-day operations entirely in cash. “Nothing has gotten violent yet,” says Andrew Freedman, Colorado’s marijuana coordination director, “but we’re kind of asking for it.”\n\nIn a recent paper, University of Alabama law school professor Julie Andersen Hill argues for legislative and regulatory changes to allow marijuana businesses to open up bank accounts.\n\nCurrently, four states – Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington – along with the District of Columbia allow recreational marijuana use. These states regulate marijuana in a manner akin to alcohol, prohibiting sales to minors, requiring business registration, and taking regulatory measures to keep other illegal drugs out of the industry.\n\nBut marijuana is still illegal under federal law. This prohibition poses numerous challenges to the rapidly growing trade, including limiting access to banking. Not only does the use of cash pose a public safety issue, but it forces marijuana businesses to forego traditional loan services and gives business owners an incentive to underreport taxes, Hill argues.\n\nThe U.S. banking system consists of both federal and state-chartered banks. A marijuana business might therefore choose to bank with a state-chartered institution in a state that has legalized marijuana use. The federal government still retains regulatory control over state-chartered banks and credit unions, however, leaving even state-level marijuana industries under the control of federal regulatory agencies.\n\nBecause marijuana is illegal under federal law, individuals and institutions that assist marijuana businesses – for example, by providing a loan, a checking account, or credit card processing – can be criminally punished as accessories and money launderers, leading to substantial fines and costly civil forfeiture.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney General issued guidance in 2013 explaining that federal authorities will not prioritize punishing financial institutions working with state-level marijuana industries. But the guidance is not binding, and the Attorney General can at any time choose to punish banks for their transactions with marijuana businesses. Even if a bank is willing to risk being prosecuted, federal law also requires it to conduct costly due diligence investigations and report any “illegal and suspicious activities” to the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\n\nAdditionally, all states require that banks obtain insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Similarly, most states require that credit unions acquire insurance from the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUA). With these sources of federal insurance comes additional federal regulation. Violating federal criminal laws might lead the FDIC or NCUA to revoke a bank or credit union’s insurance – a consequence known as the “death penalty” because it almost inevitably results in the bank’s closure. The agencies can also take enforcement action when they believe a financial institution is engaging in risky transactions.\n\nEven if a marijuana-associated bank or credit union avoids a FDIC or NCUA enforcement action, the Federal Reserve can use its terms and conditions to block the institution’s access to payment services. These services are often crucial to the bank or credit union’s operations and include check clearing, electronic fund transfers, and currency services. For example, the Colorado-chartered Fourth Corner Credit Union, which apparently offers services to businesses in the marijuana industry, filed suit in July against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve because the Board denied it a “master account” that would allow it to interact with other financial institutions.\n\nBanks are generally unwilling to risk criminal punishment and potential scrutiny from financial regulators, says Hill. These obstacles therefore keep banks and credit unions out of the marijuana industry, resulting in the present cash-only business practices.\n\nColorado has tried to combat the risks posed by the cash-only system by passing a bill permitting financial institutions to deal with the state’s recreational marijuana businesses. But even though the statute does not require so-called “cannabis credit co-ops” to obtain federal insurance, it does require them to receive Federal Reserve approval in order to access payment services. Thus far, the Fed has been unwilling to provide its endorsement. Given the Fed’s refusal and other questions surrounding the legality of financial transactions with the marijuana industry, some analysts predict the primary function of the Colorado law will be to force the federal government to give a clearer answer about the permissibility of marijuana banking.\n\nHill argues that congressional action is the only feasible solution to the marijuana industry’s banking problems. She claims that Congress must legalize or decriminalize marijuana, pass legislation protecting banks that service marijuana businesses, or both.\n\nThis spring, Representative Ed Perlmutter introduced the bipartisan Marijuana Business Access to Banking Act of 2015, which protects banks transacting with marijuana businesses. The bill was referred to the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. Senator Jeff Merkley then introduced a companion bill, which was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, where it awaits a vote.\n\nBut even if Congress takes action, Hill contends that federal financial regulators will still be able to discourage banks from associating with the marijuana industry by imposing high due diligence costs. Although Hill concedes that some due diligence is warranted, she argues that financial regulators are not well positioned to enforce marijuana laws. Instead, she believes that regulators should set clearer and more achievable due diligence standards for banks doing business with marijuana-related companies.",

    "content": "The killings of hundreds of civilians by Eritrean troops in the ancient Ethiopian town of Axum in November last year amounted to “a series of human rights and humanitarian law violations”, according to Amnesty International.\n\nThe killings in Axum, located some 187km (116 miles) north of Mekelle, capital of the Tigray region, occurred during the armed conflict between Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) last year. On November 28 and 29, Eritrean troops killed hundreds of civilians in a “coordinated and systematic” manner in order “to terrorize the population into submission”, the report, released on Friday, said.\n\nThe 41 witnesses and survivors of the massacre, all ethnic Tigrayans interviewed by Amnesty, said Eritrean forces carried out extrajudicial executions and engaged in widespread looting.\n\nThe violations began on November 19 when Eritrean and Ethiopian forces entered Axum, indiscriminately shelling the city and firing at those who tried to flee, Amnesty said, adding that after the massacre, Eritrean forces detained hundreds of residents and threatened renewed killing if they encountered resistance.\n\nThe killings, the indiscriminate shelling of Axum and the looting of property “may amount to war crimes”, Amnesty said.Axum residents identified the perpetrators as Eritrean soldiers, saying that they often rode in trucks with licence plates reading “Eritrea”.\n\nWitnesses said most wore a uniform easily distinguishable from Ethiopian soldiers, some Eritrean soldiers wore the uniform of the Ethiopian army, but were easily identified for their plastic shoes known as “Congo chama” or “shida”, which are popular in Eritrea, witnesses said.\n\nSome soldiers had three scars on each temple near the eye, marking them as Beni-Amir, an ethnic group that straddles Sudan and Eritrea but is absent from Ethiopia.\n\nLanguage also distinguished the Eritreans; the Tigrinya dialect that Eritrean soldiers speak is distinctive, with its own words and accent.\n\nEthiopian and Eritrean authorities have made contradictory statements regarding the involvement of Eritrean troops in the Tigray conflict, with some high-ranking officials denying their presence but others acknowledging it, Amnesty added.\n\nThe Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said Amnesty’s report should be taken seriously and that preliminary investigations indicated that Eritrean soldiers had killed an unknown number of civilians in Axum.\n\nEthiopia’s government has denied the presence of Eritrean soldiers in the conflict.\n\nIn a letter to Al Jazeera, Ethiopia’s ambassador to Qatar, Samia Zekaria Gutu, called the Amnesty report “cooked”.\n\n“This kind of ‘report’ based on unreliable sources in known to have the risk of further reinforcing the misinformation and propaganda by TPLF criminal clique,” Gutu wrote.\n\nLast month, the US said all soldiers from Eritrea should leave the Tigray region “immediately”.\n\nWitnesses have estimated that Eritrean soldiers number in the thousands. Eritrean officials have not responded to questions.\n\nThe information minister for Eritrea tweeted last month that “the rabid defamation campaign against Eritrea is on the rise again”.Deliberate targeting of civilians\nAmnesty quoted residents who said that the troops also carried out systematic house-to-house raids to kill teenage and adult men.\n\nOne man who had found refuge in an unfinished building said he saw a group of six Eritrean soldiers kill a neighbour with a vehicle-mounted heavy machine gun on the street near the Mana Hotel.\n\n“He was standing. I think he was confused. They were probably around 10 metres from him. They shot him in the head,” the man was quoted as saying.\n\nAnother man, who had run out of the city, returned at night after the shooting stopped.\n\n“All we could see on the streets were dead bodies and people crying,” he said.\n\nIn December, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet called the situation in Tigray “exceedingly worrying and volatile” after fighting was reported in areas surrounding Mekelle, Sheraro and Axum “in spite of government claims to the contrary”.\n\n“We have corroborated information of gross human rights violations and abuses including indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian objects, looting, abductions and sexual violence against women and girls,” Bachelet told reporters.\n\nThe conflict shook one of Africa’s most powerful and populous countries, leaving thousands of people dead and causing some 950,000 to flee their homes.\n\nBut little is known about the situation for most of Tigray’s six million people, as many journalists and aid workers have been blocked from entering, and communications are patchy.",

    "content": "Some of America’s most deeply held secrets may have been stolen in a disciplined, monthslong operation being blamed on elite Russian government hackers. The possibilities of what might have been purloined are mind-boggling.\n\nCould hackers have obtained nuclear secrets? COVID-19 vaccine data? Blueprints for next-generation weapons systems?\n\nIt will take weeks, maybe years in some cases, for digital sleuths combing through U.S. government and private industry networks to get the answers. These hackers are consummate pros at covering their tracks, experts say. Some theft may never be detected.\n\nWhat’s seems clear is that this campaign — which cybersecurity experts says exhibits the tactics and techniques of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence agency — will rank among the most prolific in the annals of cyberespionage.\n\nU.S. government agencies, including the Treasury and Commerce departments, were among dozens of high-value public- and private-sector targets known to have been infiltrated as far back as March through a commercial software update distributed to thousands of companies and government agencies worldwide. A Pentagon statement Monday indicated it used the software. It said it had “issued guidance and directives to protect” its networks. It would not say — for “operational security reasons” — whether any of its systems may have been hacked.\n\nOn Tuesday, acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller told CBS News there was so far no evidence of compromise.\n\nIn the months since the update went out, the hackers carefully exfiltrated data, often encrypting it so it wasn't clear what was being taken, and expertly covering their tracks.\n\nThomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins cyberconflict expert, said the campaign's likely efficacy can be compared to Russia’s three-year 1990s “Moonlight Maze” hacking of U.S. government targets, including NASA and the Pentagon. A U.S. investigation determined the height of the documents stolen — if printed out and piled up — would triple the height of the Washington Monument.In this case “several Washington Monument piles of documents that they took from different government agencies is probably a realistic estimate,” Rid said. “How would they use that? They themselves most likely don’t know yet.”\n\nThe Trump administration has not said which agencies were hacked. And so far no private-sector victims have come forward. Traditionally, defense contractors and telecommunications companies have been popular targets with state-backed cyber spies, Rid said.\n\nIntelligence agents generally seek the latest on weapons technologies and missile defense systems — anything vital to national security. They also develop dossiers on rival government employees, potentially for recruitment as spies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, cut short an overseas trip to hold meetings on the hack and was to convene a top-level interagency meeting later this week, the White House said in a statement.\n\nO'Brien had been scheduled to return Saturday and had to scrap plans to visit officials in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Britain, said an official familiar with his itinerary who was not authorized to discuss it and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nEarlier, the White House said a coordinating team had been created to respond, including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nAt a briefing for congressional staffers Monday, DHS did not say how many agencies were hacked, a reflection of how little the Trump administration has been sharing with Congress on the case.\n\nCritics have long complained that the Trump administration failed to address snowballing cybersecurity threats — including from ransomware attacks that have hobbled state and local governments, hospitals and even grammar schools.\n\n“It’s been a frustrating time, the last four years. I mean, nothing has happened seriously at all in cybersecurity,” said Brandon Valeriano, a Marine Corps University scholar and adviser to the Cyber Solarium Commission, which was created by Congress to fortify the nation’s cyber defenses. “It’s tough to find anything that we moved forward on at all.”\n\nTrump eliminated two key government positions: White House cybersecurity coordinator and State Department cybersecurity policy chief.\n\nValeriano said one of the few bright spots was the work of Chris Krebs, the head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, whom Trump fired for defending the integrity of the election in the face of Trump's false claims of widespread fraud.\n\nHackers infiltrated government agencies by piggybacking malicious code on commercial network management software from SolarWinds, a Texas company, beginning in March.\n\nThe campaign was discovered by the cybersecurity company FireEye when it detected it had been hacked — it disclosed the breach Dec. 8 — and alerted the FBI and other federal agencies. FireEye executive Charles Carmakal said it was aware of “dozens of incredibly high-value targets” infiltrated by the hackers and was helping “a number of organizations respond to their intrusions.” He would not name any, and said he expected many more to learn in coming days that they, too, were compromised.\n\nCarmakal said the hackers would have activated remote-access back doors only on targets sure to have prized data. It is manual, demanding work, and moving networks around risks detection.\n\nThe SolarWinds campaign highlights the lack of mandatory minimum security rules for commercial software used on federal computer networks. Zoom videoconferencing software is another example. It was approved for use on federal computer networks last year, yet security experts discovered various vulnerabilities exploitable by hackers — after federal workers sent home by the pandemic began using it.\n\nRep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat and Cyberspace Solarium Commission member, said the breach reminded him of the 2015 Chinese hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, in which the records of 22 million federal employees and government job applicants were stolen.\n\nIt highlights the need, he said, for a national cyber director at the White House, a position subject to Senate confirmation. Congress approved such a position in a recently passed defense bill.\n\n“In all of the different departments and agencies, cybersecurity is never going to be their primary mission,” Langevin said.\n\nTrump has threatened to veto the bill over objections to unrelated provisions.",

Nineteen Democrats are seeking their party's nomination to run for president in the November 2020 election. Three Republicans have announced their candidacy to challenge Trump in the party's nominating contest.\nHacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments, especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Moscow has denied any meddling.\nTensions between the United States and Iran have risen since May 2018 when Trump withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions. Trump has since reinstated U.S. sanctions, putting increased pressure on the Iranian economy, including its oil trade.\nThe Iranian government did not issue any immediate comment through state-run media on Microsoft's statement.\nPhosphorus is also known as APT 35, Charming Kitten, and Ajax Security Team, according to Microsoft.\nThe Redmond, Washington-based company said Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts.\nThe attacks were not technically sophisticated, the blog said. Hackers tried to use a significant amount of personal information to attack targets, it said.\n\"This effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering,\" the blog post said.\nMicrosoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and said in March that it had received a court order to take control of 99 websites the group used to execute attacks https://bit.ly/2TDKee1.\nA computer network used by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-democrats-investigation-idINKCN10B033 was hacked in a cyberattack on Democratic Party political organizations in that U.S. election.\nBig tech companies are under pressure to ramp up security for next year's U.S. elections and others around the world.\nCompanies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft and Twitter Inc met with U.S. intelligence agencies earlier in September to discuss security strategies.\nMicrosoft had said in a blog post in July http://bit.ly/332WKJ1 that about 10,000 customers were targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks in the past year. Most of the activity originated from hackers in three countries: Iran, North Korea and Russia, the company said.",

Mandated by the United Nations, ISAF’s primary objective was to enable the Afghan government to provide effective security across the country and develop new Afghan security forces to ensure Afghanistan would never again become a safe haven for terrorists. From 2011, responsibility for security was gradually transitioned to Afghan forces, which took the lead for security operations across the country by summer 2013. The transition process was completed and Afghan forces assumed full security responsibility at the end of 2014, when the ISAF mission was completed. A new, smaller non-combat mission (“Resolute Support”) was launched on 1 January 2015 to provide further training, advice and assistance to the Afghan security forces and institutions.ISAF was one of the largest coalitions in history and is NATO’s most challenging mission to date. At its height, the force was more than 130,000 strong, with troops from 51 NATO and partner nations.\n\nOriginally deployed to provide security in and around the capital Kabul, ISAF’s presence was gradually expanded to cover the whole country by the second half of 2006.  As ISAF expanded into the east and south, its troops became increasingly engaged in fighting a growing insurgency in 2007 and 2008, while trying to help Afghanistan rebuild. In 2009, a new counter-insurgency was launched and 40,000 extra troops were deployed.\n\nIn support of the Afghan government, ISAF assisted the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in the conduct of security operations throughout the country, helping to reduce the capability of the insurgency.\n\nAn important priority for ISAF was to increase the capacity and capabilities of the Afghan forces. This became the main focus of the mission from 2011 onwards, as responsibility for security was progressively transitioned to Afghan lead and ISAF shifted from a combat-centric role to training, advising and assisting.\n\nThe multinational force also helped to create the space and lay the foundations for improvements in governance and socio-economic development for sustainable stability.",

    "content": "As a kid growing up in Midwest America, there was always an equal playing field for Chris Mosier. He felt confident anywhere he could score a goal, cross a finish line or make a play. The minute he stepped up to compete, the only distinction between him and any other athlete was ability. “At any point in my life, regardless if I was confused about who I was or if I didn’t know the language of what I felt, the one identifier that never changed was ‘athlete,'” he says. No matter how his hair was cut, what clothes he wore or if people called him “he” or “she” – there was no confusion about his competitive edge.\n\nBut decades later, when he qualified for the 2016 Team USA roster at the sprint duathlon national championship and became the first out transgender man to make a U.S. National Team, the place where Chris Mosier’s athletic prowess was valued over his personal pronoun – that equal playing field–changed. “Suddenly, the most gratifying area of my life became the most contentious area of my life,” he says.\n\nLocker rooms he’d been using for years were suddenly inaccessible. The pool where lap lengths had stretched into miles of training shorted him admission. At a Team USA qualifying race in North Carolina in June (which decides the 2017 roster), Mosier couldn’t even use the restroom due to the currently standing HB2 law. He was the same person, the same athlete, but one sentence had changed everything. “I knew that the minute I said, ‘I’m a trans athlete,’ that I would never get away from it,” he says. “But I asked myself, ‘Why does it matter?’ Well, it matters because there was no one else out there saying it.”\n\nIt wasn’t until after college that Mosier became a competitive triathlete and duathlete (the duathlon is a race that follows a run-bike-run format, while triathlon maintains the traditional swim-bike-run arrangement). During his time at Northern Michigan University, he edited the school newspaper, hosted a radio show, played rec sports, and performed as the school’s mascot – Wildcat Willie. He did anything he could to stay busy, because busy felt safe. “I didn’t have enough time for relationships, to put myself out there, or have people get to know me,” he says. “I didn’t have to have these critical conversations about who I was.”And then he fell in love.\n\nWhen Mosier met the woman who is now his wife, Zhen Heinemann, the conversations that used to end in confusion began to bring clarity. “I dated men all through college, and there I met the woman who is my wife,” he explains. “At the time, I was trying to figure out my sexuality and what that meant. I didn’t know a lot of gay people – and I didn’t know any trans people. All I knew is that I would get furious if people said we were lesbian. I would think, ‘That doesn’t fit for me. That’s not right because I’m not gay.’ At that time it came onto my radar – I had never thought about my gender identity before.” The term “gay” didn’t fit for Mosier because he did not identify as a woman. Being gay would not be a problem, except for the fact that he didn’t feel like a woman. Today, Mosier identifies as queer.\n\nSuddenly, it made sense to Chris why walking up to the start line of women’s races was uncomfortable and anxiety inducing. Sharing his results from top finishes in women’s competition felt wrong because Mosier is perceived as a straight, white man. “Triathlon is a body-conscious sport,” he says. “I was upset with breasts. I worked so hard to have my body look and compete the way I wanted it to. But I didn’t have the flat chest and a six-pack that I thought I would. My body didn’t betray me — but my body did disappoint me.”\n\nIn 2010, Mosier began his transition – taking testosterone, changing his gender designation on documents, and competing in men’s triathlons and duathlons.It wasn’t easy, but it finally felt right.\n\nBut as an athlete, Mosier knows that it’s never easy to break a record, let alone break a barrier. His sports heroes have always been those who claimed championships and provoked social change. While everyone else in his hometown of Lake Zurich, Illinois, had been worshipping Michael Jordan as kids, Mosier was lauding Tommie Smith. “We all want to see something we desire to be,” he explains. “But I didn’t have that model to look at and say, ‘That’s me. I could be like that someday.’ So I either had to give up on knowing that someone like me could be competing at a high level or I had to do it myself. That’s what really drives me – being the athlete that young trans athletes can look at and see themselves in.”\n\nBecause of recent regulatory changes from the International Olympic Commission (IOC), the World Anti-Doping Agency, USA Triathlon and other governing bodies of athletics, trans athletes who have undergone hormone therapy for one year and pass Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) tests are allowed to compete without restriction. By becoming the first trans athlete to compete at the highest level–the Team USA level–Mosier actualized his own version of Tommie Smith. But earning his spot on the Team USA roster wasn’t enough to break the barrier for all trans athletes.\n\nBefore the new IOC policy (and others that write trans athletes into the rulebook) became officially enacted in January 2016, Mosier and other trans athletes had to play a regulatory waiting game. For nearly six months–from June until January–trans athletes, regardless of team standings, were ineligible for international and national competition. When the IOC and other governing bodies solidified the current regulations on transgender athlete eligibility in January, the frustration, the inequality, and the fears Mosier had faced finally felt redeemed. “It’s a relief that next barrier has been knocked down,” he says. “It was initially frustrating, but more than frustrating it was disappointing to see the regulatory inequality and the issues that not only I faced, but so many trans athletes faced. Through the process it became so clear why so many trans people quit playing sports. But now those old rules aren’t a reason to quit.” That driven, competitive nature is what drove Mosier to persist in gaining recognition for trans athletes. “When I think back to growing up as an athlete, every positive thing that I learned about goals, dedication, leadership, and values I learned from playing sports – this was an area of my life where I felt the best about myself,” he says. “That shouldn’t change because a pronoun has changed. I took this on because I think all athletes and all people should have the opportunity to play sports and have a place where they can feel their best about themselves.”\n\nMosier expressed that often, worrying about how other athletes, the public and organizations will react is what delays trans gender athletes when making the decision to come out. It’s possible for transgender athletes can compete without making public announcements of transition. Knowing he had the option to privately navigate sports as a man, it took Mosier years to decide to come out publicly as a trans gender athlete. But he did so to set precedence. “It’s like running the four-minute mile,” he explains. “First people say it can’t be done. Then someone does it. Then it’s done again and again, faster and faster – just because the impossible was possible.”\n\nMosier has done it, and he hopes the next trans athletes will do it better – possibly in Rio. The new IOC regulations opened the 2016 Summer Games to trans gender athletes, and according to IOC meeting records, two closeted transgender athletes will be competing in August. The nationalities of the transgender athletes were not revealed, but sources state that one will be competing for Team Great Britain.\n\nAnd although Mosier has received a great deal of support from Team USA as an organization and from individual Team USA athletes across multisport platforms, he understands that this is just a small facet of approval in the worldwide scale of athletics. “Just because the rules allow it doesn’t mean that everyone is ready to accept it,” he explains. “Public opinion is the challenging piece.”\n\nIndividual athletes and media outlets, from former Olympic judo competitor Ronda Rousey to The Australian (a weekly newspaper published in Australia) have spoken against the IOC’s policy on allowing transgender athletes to compete, often stating that transgender women often have a competitive edge due to higher levels of testosterone. In one scathing statement, Rousey spoke against fellow MMA professional and transgender athlete Fallon Fox, saying, “She can try hormones, chop her pecker off, but it’s still the same bone structure a man has. It’s an advantage. I don’t think it’s fair.”\n\nBut despite knee-jerk reactions and opinions, science provides a clear explanation for why, in many sports, transgender athletes don’t maintain any athletic advantage. “The flash point for a lot of people is, ‘You’re going to allow penises in women’s sports?'” Joanna Harper, chief medical physicist of radiation oncology at Providence Portland Medical Center and attendant of the IOC meeting regarding transgender regulation, said in a USA Today report . “It’s not the anatomy that matters, it’s the hormones.” For transgender men, the practical target for hormone therapy is to increase testosterone levels to the normal male physiological range (300–1000 ng/dl) by administering testosterone. A practical hormonal target for transgender women through hormone therapy is to decrease testosterone levels to the normal female range (30–100 ng/dl) without supra-physiological levels of estradiol (<200 pg/ml) by administering an antiandrogen and estrogen. According to studies, as testosterone levels approach female norms, trans women see a decrease in muscle mass, bone density and the number of oxygen-carrying red cells in their blood. Estrogen boosts fat storage. Together, these changes lead to a loss of speed, strength and endurance – all key components to any athletic advantage. No one gets bigger, faster and stronger on estrogen. \n\nTo abide by current IOC regulation, an athlete must demonstrate that her total testosterone level in serum has been below 10 nmol/L for at least 12 months prior to her first competition (with the requirement for any longer period to be based on a confidential case-by-case evaluation, considering whether or not 12 months is a sufficient length of time to minimize any advantage in women’s competition).\n\nFor transgender men such as Mosier, lab tests, constant medical updates, and annual reports allow clearance so athletes can compete under Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) and avoid any accusations of using necessary testosterone as a performance-enhancing drug.\nThe processes transgender athletes must undergo to compete are not lenient by any means. Keep in mind that the IOC ruled that drinking too much coffee as an unfair competitive advantage for almost 20 years. Today, many common cough syrups, eye drops, cold medications, diet products, nasal sprays and allergy medications will result in a failed drug test and medical disqualification. Historically, the IOC does not approach matters of unfair advantage with a lack of caution.\n\nCurrently, no trans athlete has dominated a sport on the national or international level. Naataphon Wangyot, a transgender high school athlete in Alaska, recently earned All-State honors in track and field. Wangyot’s victory was a positive stride, but public commentary proved that many are not ready to normalize transgender athletic participation. As Mosier puts it, “the comments people made about this high school girl were outrageous, so at the most elite level, regardless of how well they do, trans athletes are targets for this sort of commentary.”\n\nHe believes this is what’s keeping the two trans athletes at Rio from coming out publicly. “We are still a long way from normalizing the participation and success of trans athletes–but I hope that what comes out of all of this.” He believes that one day, “Chris is a transgender man” will be seen as a fun fact to the public — as benign as “Chris can juggle,” or, “Chris has pet rabbits.”\n\n“When I came out to friends, family, and teammates, it wasn’t a big issue because they knew me,” he explains. “I want to be visible so people can know me or at least, know of me and that I exist. It’s a very different experience when you put the person before the pronoun.”\n\nSo Chris Mosier continues to train. He continues to speak out publicly and advocate for LGBT athletes. He continues to comply with testing regulations. He continues to make the playing field feel as equal as it did when he was just an athletic kid in Illinois. “I’m going to keep busting my ass to get on the podium – and hopefully that makes it better for other people” he says. “I want to be the person I needed 10 years ago.”",

Tunisia Youth Impact is using cooking contests to encourage young Tunisian women in rural villages to go to the ballot box and vote in the country’s presidential election. \n\nADVERTISING\nIt is Saturday, October 12, in the small rural town of Echamine, around 20km south of Tunis. The next day, the country will vote in the second round of a presidential election pitting Nabil Karoui against Kais Saied in a head-to-head runoff.\n\nBut the chances are that here and in towns like it across the country, not everyone – in fact fewer than half of voters – will be heading to the ballot box. In the first round, the national turnout was just 48.98%.\n\nTunisia Youth Impact is hoping to change that, all through the power of gastronomy. Its Voticook cooking contests, in which participants vote for the winner, aims to raise awareness among rural populations, and particularly women, of the importance of participating in the democratic process.\n\nPractice vote\n\n“It’s a practice vote,” explains Wafa Tarhouni, president of the association. “It’s a competition between a certainnumber of women who compete through their dishes to be elected by the diners at the meal.”\n\nFrom electoral lists to voting booths and sealed ballot boxes, the volunteers from Tunisia Youth Impact strive to match as closely as possible real-life voting conditions. The only difference is that the ink into which voters in Tunisia are normally required to dip their fingers to show they have cast their ballot has been replaced by a mixture of water and shampoo.\n\nIn Echamine, the day’s contest is being held in the concrete courtyard of a two-story house, still only half-built. It is the home of mother-of-four Hinda Jlass who, surrounded by her children and with a smile on her face, is preparing her own couscous for the competition.\n\n“This event is above all a way of getting together with other women, and the essential thing is to participate,” she says.\n\nParticipating is something the 50-year-old housewife also plans to do on Sunday when she will cast her ballot in the second round of the presidential election. It will be only the second time she has voted in her life.At noon, Jlass is joined by the other competitors from the village, seven in all. These are the candidates. But rather than a political programme they will be presenting their best culinary creations to the electors – in this case a group of around fifty people.\n\nEU observers\n\nEach competitor will get a chance to say a few words about their dish – mainly couscous but also plates of macaroni and a rice dish, all accompanied by traditional mechouia salads and honey-flavoured makroudh pastries.\n\nThe “electors” will taste each concoction before voting for their favourite, using the exact same procedure they will use to cast their ballot in the presidential election the next day. Tunisia Youth Impact volunteers will be on hand to guide them through the voting process and make sure no one misses a step that might invalidate their vote.\n\nAdding to the realism is the presence of members of the ISIE, the Tunisian election authority, and Stefan Ziegler, a European Union election observer.“It’s original and everyone seems to be having fun,” Ziegler says with a smile. “It can only be a good thing for Tunisian democracy.”\n\nAfter the vote, the ballots are counted. It is another opportunity for volunteers to point out the mistakes that might lead to a vote being declared invalid: a signature instead of a cross next to the chosen candidate, for example.\n\nA clear winner soon emerges: Najwa Jlass, the sister of the hostess.\n\n“I’m of course very happy to have won,” she says, clearly a little moved. “But what makes me happier is to see our community come together like this.” She adds that she will be going to vote “for real” the next day.",

I really missed it when I was off. I’m happy I’m still able to play and compete with the best.”\n\nSiegemund, ranked 66th in the world, was appearing in the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career and had lost her only meeting against the tall and big-serving left-hander 6-1 6-1 at the U.S. Open in 2015.\n\nThe 32-year-old did not pose a challenge in the opening set as Kvitova put in a near-perfect show.\n\nThe left-hander hit six aces, lost a single point on her first serve and converted her first breakpoint opportunity to canter through the opener in 34 minutes. She hit 14 winners against five unforced errors.\n\nBut the German gave a good account of her fighting spirit in the second despite suffering a lower back problem midway through.\nKvitova broke serve early but started having trouble with double faults. She saved three breakpoint chances before the German converted the next to get the set back on serve at 2-2.\n\nSiegemund saved three breakpoints from 0-40 in the next game but lost her cool at the umpire after getting a time violation warning at 40-40 and suffered another break.\n\nShe then called the trainer to get a massage on her lower back and returned to break Kvitova to get the set back on serve.\n\nKvitova, however, kept her focus and got the decisive break in the next game and then converted her second match point when her opponent served a double fault.\n\n“You are playing the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam so I expected her to play very well, which she showed whole match,” Kvitova added.\n\nThe Czech will meet the winner of the all-American clash between Danielle Collins and Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin for a place in her maiden final at Roland Garros.",

The economy will shrink by nearly 6 percent this year, they expect, but add that the Netherlands is better off than many other European countries, NOS reports.\n\nThe worst shock to the economy is already behind the Netherlands. This happened in the second quarter, when all kinds of sectors were forced to closed. Between March and early June, Rabobank expects the economy shrunk by 8 percent. The catering industry in particular was hit hard. \"Restaurants and cafes are allowed to open again, causing the catering industry to pick up somewhat from the deep valley of the second quarter,\" Ester Barendregt of Rabobank said to NOS. \"But for the year as a whole, a contraction of 41 percent remains for this sector.\"\n\nOther sectors are still awaiting their toughest period. \"For example, the biggest blow to industry is likely to come in the third quarter,\" Barendregt said. \"Construction got off to a very strong start this year, but will now also be delayed by the corona crisis and the long-standing nitrogen problems.\" Like the sector itself, the bank expects shrinkage in construction to continue into 2021.\n\nUnemployment will continue to rise. At the start of this year, 284 thousand Netherlands residents were unemployed, an unemployment rate of 3 percent. Rabobank expects this to rise to 7 percent by the end of this year. In the coming months, more and more self-employed and freelancers will be without work. There will also be more reorganizations and bankruptcies, resulting in employees with permanent contracts losing their jobs.\n\nCompanies are also faced with consumers who have less to spend. The outlook for exports deteriorated. And many of the Netherlands' major trading partners were also hit hard by the pandemic. Dutch companies will therefore export 7.2 percent less goods and services this year, Rabobank said.\n\n\"The corona crisis is a huge blow to the Dutch economy,\" Barendregt said to NOS. \"Nevertheless, the Dutch expectations this year are still relatively mild if you look at other countries in the eurozone.\" Due to the Netherlands 'intelligent lockdown', not all sectors had to close and the Dutch economy was in good shape when the pandemic started. Combine that with a high degree of digitization in the Netherlands, and the first coronavirus blows were more easily absorbed by the Netherlands than other EU countries, according to the bank. Rabobank expects that the Dutch economy will grow again next year, by 2.9 percent.\n\nOther countries that implemented stricter policies, like France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, are likely to see their economies shrink by over 10 percent this year, according to the bank. But their economic growth will pick up faster next year, with Rabobank expecting growth figures of 7 to 8 percent in the above three countries. \"This is partly a logical consequence of the less deep fall at the beginning of the corona crisis. But it is also because the Netherlands is relatively vulnerable to a drop in demand from abroad",

That in less than seven minutes, the knot of fear and anxiety unspooling at speed will swallow you whole, rendering your life blank and your existence meaningless? And all because you failed to prepare! You idiot! And now you’re on a train carriage in a clammy panic desperately searching for hope. Also known as “a plug point”. Also known as the one thing keeping you connected and alive, contactable at all times for an urgent call about the missold PPI you’ve never bought.\n\nDead-battery anxiety is a thing. Last week a man named Robin Lee was told he would be arrested, presumably for crimes against electricity, if he refused to unplug his iPhone from a socket on the London Overground. He didn’t, and he was – only to be “de-arrested” later while self-righteously claiming “the whole thing was ridiculous”, unlike his normalised need to be “on” at all times.The week before, 19-year-old Nick Silvestri jumped on a Broadway stage and tried to jam his phone in a prop outlet because it was on 5% and “Girls were calling all day. What would you do?”. What would you do? A 2012 study shows that 77% of his peers in the US are nomophobes – a real-life condition recognised as a fear of having no mobile battery or coverage; one suffered by a reported 66% of the British population.\n\nThe best (or worst, depending on how dependent you are on your mobile) remains an as-yet unnamed woman filmed on public transport in Hong Kong, dealing with her dead phone by screaming and crying for help. She’s hysterically inconsolable. Her phone remains dead, her dignity buried.\n\nI don’t want to say we’ve all been there, but to a greater or lesser degree, we have. I get it. Your phone battery hovers in the red zone and your brain hits auto-twitch, scanning the immediate vicinity for power. It’s a universal problem. It’s also really easily fixable through self-imposed exposure therapy.\n\nTake it from an expert: I’ve reached Buddha levels of zen. Not because of any luddite tendencies, but because the longest relationship I’ve had with a pristine iPhone is 4 months; I’ve been using and losing them since 2007. Keeping a tally of phones loved and lost stalled around iPhone number 13, two summers ago. It gets easier to let go of phone-battery anxiety when you’re not that anxious about having a phone in the first place. Here’s some tips to help you cope:\n\nGo cold turkey\n\nThe first rule of phone freedom is to have liberated yourself from your device at least twice in your life. The first to experience it, the second to be experienced at it. The number of times you lose it, break it, have it stolen, or drop it in the toilet bowl after that depends on how keen you are to master not caring about being connected to the modern world.\n\nExperience the real trauma\n\nThe real faff isn’t in being phoneless, it’s in the interminable admin involved in getting re-connected – registering the police report; the call to your mobile network to block your phone; the plea to your insurance company to file your claim; the slog to the DHL depot to pick up your new phone because the courier couldn’t be bothered to ring your doorbell. Agony, but also an excellent lesson in perspective: no power is a temporary drag, but phone admin will destroy your soul.\n\nPretend not to care\n\nThe third rule is to establish a laissez-faire “attitude” towards your phone as an essential part of your being. Friends of yours who haven’t met one another before will use your haplessness as an easy thing to bond over. Jokes will be made about phones needing to be made out of velcro or sold to you like mittens on string. You’ll hear the same ones over and over: weather it.\n\nHave multiple backup plans (none of which is “buy a portable charger”)\n\nSure, your battery is dead, but this is why you also carry a tablet, for that key moment when you’re out and can pull an iPad from your giant bag at 10.37pm in a restaurant to check exactly why 50 Cent has gone bankrupt. What, your tablet is cracked and/or it needs charging? No problem, you keep five essential numbers on you at all times, and are always with someone who won’t mind you using their phone. Wait: no one trusts you to ever go near their expensive mobile and you’ve run out of friends? Don’t worry about it, it’s really easy to keep talking to this barman until he says you can iMessage your flatmate to say you’re going to be late and you don’t have your keys, please don’t move house.\n\nClearly I’m an idiot. But then, I figure, so are you. Being forced to live in the moment is different to evangelically boring on about it; but if there’s one thing worse than someone you can’t get hold of, it’s the person unable to “go dark” without bleating “do you know where I can charge my phone?” to every other person.\n\nBut remember: no major moment in history will go undocumented because you weren’t recording it. The two hours when your phone died were probably not the ones when Prince decided to cold-call you. The biggest lesson learnt when you recharge to find no missed calls? You’re not as important as you think you are – and if you are, you’ll never be that unreachable in the first place.",

    "content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Climate change activists, including one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, defied a police order to end protests on Tuesday after a week of disruption in London, targeting Britain’s transport ministry and security agency MI5.Gail Bradbrook, one of the founders of the group that is half way through two weeks of actions around the world, climbed onto the top of the entrance of the transport ministry to protest at a high-speed rail project known as HS2.\n\n“This is nature defending herself,” Bradbrook said, as civil servants looked on from a gallery inside the building and police cordoned the street. “I’m doing this for your children.”\n\nInvoking the example of women’s suffrage activist Emmeline Pankhurst, Bradbrook tried to smash one of the ministry’s windows with a hammer and screwdriver before she was brought down by a police climber in a cherry-picker and arrested.\n\nThe group, which uses civil disobedience to highlight the risks posed by climate change and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species, has staged a fresh wave of protest actions in cities from Amsterdam to Melbourne since October 7.\n\nIn New York, activists glued themselves to a green sailboat parked in Broadway last week to highlight rising sea levels. In Brussels, police used water cannon on Saturday to disperse hundreds of Extinction Rebellion activists gathered in a square.\n\nPolice ordered a halt to all of the group’s protests in London on Monday, saying those who did not comply would be arrested. They have already made around 1,500 arrests over the past eight days, including more than 90 at a day of actions in the British capital’s financial district on Monday.More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 20 cities in other countries, Extinction Rebellion said.\n\nThe British government reinforced the police call on it to stop. “While we share people’s concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people’s day-to-day lives,” a government spokeswoman said.\n\nThe activists oppose plans to run the HS2 rail project through ancient woodlands. The ministry says the rail line will slash journey times between central and northern England and the capital and be much more efficient in carbon terms than driving.\n\nThe project is billions of pounds over budget and running late and an independent review is considering whether it should go ahead.\n\nAn activist who tried to lock herself to the ministry said the project would be a “scar across the belly of this land” destroying vital habitats for barn owls, bees and birds.\n\n“Everybody who is not paying attention is numb at the moment. We all use tactics to numb ourselves because this is scary,” said the woman, who gave her name as April, before she was taken away in a police van.Later, police began arresting Extinction Rebellion activists who had assembled to block a road running past the headquarters of the MI5 security service to highlight the risks climate change poses to food security, a Reuters witness said.\n\n“A significant policing operation continues and we will take robust action against anyone engaged in unlawful protests at locations targeted by Extinction Rebellion,” London police’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said HS2 would damage or destroy 108 ancient woodlands in the largest single act of deforestation in Britain since World War One.\n\nThe transport ministry said 7 million new trees and shrubs, including over 40 native species specific to each location will be planted as part of the programme.\n\nSupporters say HS2 would give Britain the kind of fast rail services enjoyed by other major countries. Current estimates predict it will cost around 88 billion pounds ($111.5 billion).",

I really missed it when I was off. I’m happy I’m still able to play and compete with the best.”\n\nSiegemund, ranked 66th in the world, was appearing in the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career and had lost her only meeting against the tall and big-serving left-hander 6-1 6-1 at the U.S. Open in 2015.\n\nThe 32-year-old did not pose a challenge in the opening set as Kvitova put in a near-perfect show.\n\nThe left-hander hit six aces, lost a single point on her first serve and converted her first breakpoint opportunity to canter through the opener in 34 minutes. She hit 14 winners against five unforced errors.\n\nBut the German gave a good account of her fighting spirit in the second despite suffering a lower back problem midway through.Kvitova broke serve early but started having trouble with double faults. She saved three breakpoint chances before the German converted the next to get the set back on serve at 2-2.\n\nSiegemund saved three breakpoints from 0-40 in the next game but lost her cool at the umpire after getting a time violation warning at 40-40 and suffered another break.\n\nShe then called the trainer to get a massage on her lower back and returned to break Kvitova to get the set back on serve.\n\nKvitova, however, kept her focus and got the decisive break in the next game and then converted her second match point when her opponent served a double fault.\n\n“You are playing the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam so I expected her to play very well, which she showed whole match,” Kvitova added.\n\nThe Czech will meet the winner of the all-American clash between Danielle Collins and Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin for a place in her maiden final at Roland Garros.",

    "content": "Good evening.\n\nToday we add an important chapter in our fight against COVID-19. We took the decision to make available for European citizens the first COVID-19 vaccine. We granted conditional marketing authorisation to the vaccine produced by BioNTech and Pfizer.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency assessed this vaccine thoroughly. And it concluded that it is safe and effective against COVID-19. Based on this scientific assessment, we proceeded to authorise it for the European Union market.\n\nAs we have promised, this vaccine will be available for all EU countries, at the same time, on the same conditions. The first batches of this vaccine will be shipped from Pfizer's manufacturing site here in Belgium within the next days.\n\nI have always said, during this pandemic, that we are in this together. So vaccination can start at the same time, during the European Union vaccination days, on 27, 28 and 29 December. This is a very good way to end this difficult year, and to finally start turning the page on COVID-19.\n\nThis is our first vaccine. More will be approved soon, if they prove to be safe and effective. EMA will issue its opinion on the second vaccine, that of Moderna, on 6 January. \n\nAnd while we deliver vaccines for Europeans, we also help secure them for the rest of the world. Team Europe is the largest contributor to the COVAX Facility, with over EUR 800 million for procuring vaccines for the low- and middle-income countries.\n\nFinally, allow me to say how proud I am that the first COVID-19 vaccine available in Europe is a true product of European innovation. BioNTech has received more than EUR 9 million of EU research funding over the past decade, to develop these really ground-breaking technologies. And it secured a EUR 100 million loan from the European Investment Bank, that is backed by the European Union, in June. This helped expand its manufacturing capacities and supply the vaccine quickly worldwide. And this is a true European success story.\n\nThank you so much.",

In Brussels, police used water cannon on Saturday to disperse hundreds of Extinction Rebellion activists gathered in a square.\n\nPolice ordered a halt to all of the group’s protests in London on Monday, saying those who did not comply would be arrested. They have already made around 1,500 arrests over the past eight days, including more than 90 at a day of actions in the British capital’s financial district on Monday.More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 20 cities in other countries, Extinction Rebellion said.\n\nThe British government reinforced the police call on it to stop. “While we share people’s concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people’s day-to-day lives,” a government spokeswoman said.\n\nThe activists oppose plans to run the HS2 rail project through ancient woodlands. The ministry says the rail line will slash journey times between central and northern England and the capital and be much more efficient in carbon terms than driving.\n\nThe project is billions of pounds over budget and running late and an independent review is considering whether it should go ahead.\n\nAn activist who tried to lock herself to the ministry said the project would be a “scar across the belly of this land” destroying vital habitats for barn owls, bees and birds.\n\n“Everybody who is not paying attention is numb at the moment. We all use tactics to numb ourselves because this is scary,” said the woman, who gave her name as April, before she was taken away in a police van.Later, police began arresting Extinction Rebellion activists who had assembled to block a road running past the headquarters of the MI5 security service to highlight the risks climate change poses to food security, a Reuters witness said.\n\n“A significant policing operation continues and we will take robust action against anyone engaged in unlawful protests at locations targeted by Extinction Rebellion,” London police’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said HS2 would damage or destroy 108 ancient woodlands in the largest single act of deforestation in Britain since World War One.\n\nThe transport ministry said 7 million new trees and shrubs, including over 40 native species specific to each location will be planted as part of the programme.\n\nSupporters say HS2 would give Britain the kind of fast rail services enjoyed by other major countries. Current estimates predict it will cost around 88 billion pounds ($111.5 billion).",

    "content": "The tiny south Asian country of Bhutan is best known for its concept of “Gross National Happiness,” a Buddhism-inspired alternative to Gross Domestic Product. And consistent with the peaceful image of the small country wedged between India and China, Bhutan’s small LGBT population has experienced very little persecution or violence.\n\nThen again, most people don’t know they exist.\n\n“I’ve never really faced any kind of harassment,” Karma Dupchen, who at 23 is one of the most public LGBT figures in the country, told The Daily Beast. Yet “growing up gay in Bhutan was a very alienating experience for me,” Dupchen said, because in Bhutan, the idea of being gay or transgender is “pretty much unheard of.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean that same-sex desires or cross-gender identities don’t exist there, of course, but there is no widely shared language with which to discuss them. Lesbianism, in particular, is under-recognized, according to anecdotal reports from the Bhutanese media (like this article from the Bhutanese Observer in 2008), and the distinction between lesbians and transgender men is blurry (as demonstrated in this 2013 interview in which one individual referred to himself/herself as both).\n\nIn 2013, as he was beginning to come out, Dupchen created the Facebook page LGBT Bhutan, the first public attempt at a visible outlet for the Bhutanese LGBT community. Dupchen has a few friends who are out to each other, but aside from himself, the only other publicly out figures he could point to were Passang Dorji, who was interviewed about being gay this year on a popular Bhutanese talk show, and Dechen Seldon, a young transgender woman who made international news when she asked to wear traditional female garb at school.\n\nTo date, Bhutan has no LGBT nonprofits, no LGBT bars or bookstores, no LGBT institutions whatsoever.\n\nIn theory, Bhutan still has a colonial-era anti-sodomy law that punishes “sexual conduct that is against the order of nature” with jail terms of up to a year. In practice, however, no one has ever been prosecuted for sodomy, and some members of Parliament have expressed openness to overturning it, as part of Bhutan’s relatively new commitment to democratic ideals: The country transitioned from an absolute monarchy (a kind of enlightened despotism in which Bhutan’s rulers pursued policies that would maximize the population’s happiness) to a constitutional one in 2008.\n\nYet even this embrace of democracy was idiosyncratic, with many justifying the move as useful to curry favor with Western powers. Bhutan remains a unique nation, in which its national and religious identities are carefully preserved against globalization.\n\nThis relatively benign isolation is reflected in Bhutan’s policies toward LGBT people.\n\nDechen Wangmo is a public health consultant who works with the Bhutanese Ministry of Health and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on HIV/AIDS prevention. She helped launch Lhak-Sam, Bhutan’s network for HIV positive people. The policies in Bhutan are good: The Bhutanese government provides free treatment for all people with HIV or AIDS.\n\nBut the level of understanding is low. Wangmo helped conduct behavioral surveys to try to capture an accurate representation of the number of men who have sex with men (often abbreviated MSMs in the language of sexual epidemiology) in Bhutan. In a country of 770,000, the UNDP estimated in 2012 that there were some 4,000 MSMs. (The study did not attempt to measure female sexuality, since international HIV/AIDS work still focuses on men who sleep with men.)\n\nBut when Wangmo presented the results of that study to some members of the Bhutanese government, she told The Daily Beast, “The Health Secretary came up to me and asked me, ‘Have you seen one? Have you actually talked to an MSM in Bhutan?’”\n\nMoreover, said Wangmo, for those still unaware of LGBT identities, “any concept that you are not exposed to, that’s the easiest way out: Blame it on the West.” This is particularly problematic in Bhutan, which proudly resists Western cultural influences it deems to be harmful to Gross National Happiness.\n\nInterestingly, unlike in many Christian and Muslim countries, religion in Bhutan is often part of the solution, not part of the problem. For example, this year, Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, a filmmaker and Buddhist lama from Bhutan, uploaded a video to YouTube in which he said of sexual diversity, “You should not be tolerating this, actually. You should be respecting it…. If you are tolerating this, it means that you think it’s something wrong that you will tolerate. But you have to go beyond that.”\n\nKhyentse also said that being LGBT in no way impacted one’s understanding of or adherence to Buddhism, which is the official religion of Bhutan.\n\nFor his part, Dupchen told The Daily Beast that “the situation in Bhutan is improving every year… A few years ago, no one could have been able to go out and hang out together, or even dare to be open and be happy about it.” But now, he says, ignorance is dissipating as visibility increases.\n\nDupchen’s experience shows that even in places with little stigma or overt violence, the experience of being different can be alienating, especially in small communities. This makes online efforts like Dupchen’s LGBT Bhutan Facebook group so critical. In a tiny nation like Bhutan, every like counts.",

    "content": "A man was killed and two women were injured in a shooting Thursday afternoon in the lobby of Smith Tower Apartments in downtown Vancouver.\n\nThe suspected shooter, identified by police as Robert E. Breck, 80, a resident of the senior living building, was taken into custody after a standoff with law enforcement that lasted nearly 2 ½ hours.\n\nThe victims have not yet been identified. However, the two who were injured were transported to PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center, where a hospital spokesman said both were in satisfactory condition. \n\nBreck was booked into the Clark County Jail on suspicion of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder, according to the Vancouver Police Department. He will make a first appearance on the allegations Friday morning in Clark County Superior Court.\n\nHe allegedly fired shots in the building’s lobby shortly after 2 p.m. A 77-year-old man, who’s a resident and asked not to be identified, said he saw Breck enter the building through the side door. The witness entered through the same door a short time later. When he got inside, the witness said he saw Breck standing with a handgun in the lobby and heard “boom-boom.” The witness turned and fled. He went to the dress shop next door and called 911, he said. \n\nPolice were summoned at 2:09 p.m. to 515 Washington St., where they found three victims in the lobby suffering from gunshot wounds. Breck was holed up in his apartment on the building’s 13th floor on the south side.\n\nArmed SWAT officers swarmed the building. Teams of four officers, holding the victims’ arms and legs, carried them out the front door — one appeared to be dead. The injured victims were tended to in the building’s parking lot until paramedics arrived and transported them to the hospital.\n\nShortly after, witnesses to the shooting were ushered from the building by law enforcement and taken to City Hall to be interviewed.\n\nAfter police identified Breck as the suspect, a crisis negotiation team started communicating with him via phone before 3 p.m. SWAT officers evacuated the residents who were able to navigate the stairs and told the rest to shelter in place. The elevators inside the 15-story tower were shut off as police worked to contain the gunman to the 13th floor, where a drone hovered outside his window.At about 4:35 p.m., police led Breck out of the building. He was wearing a gray T-shirt, plaid pajama pants and a baseball cap.\n\nA few bystanders clapped and cheered as Breck was escorted to a patrol vehicle.\n\n“He was taken into custody without incident. … We are continuing the investigation into the whole incident,” Vancouver Police Department spokeswoman Kim Kapp said in a media briefing outside Smith Tower. Police have not released a motive.\n\n“We don’t have any information really related to what precipitated it,” she said. “That will be a big part of the investigation, to figure that out.”\n\nLaw enforcement did not fire their weapons during the incident, Kapp said.\n\nA 12th floor resident, who was friends with the man who was killed, said she watched SWAT officers walk past her door through the peep hole.\n\n“They had their guns drawn,” said the resident, who declined to give her name. “They said, ‘Stay in your apartment.’ ” She was later evacuated from the building through the garage. She said she saw her friend lying on the ground.\n\n“I had just been in the lobby with this guy,” she said, adding that he was on his way to sell a motorcycle and was dressed in leathers. “I took his picture. I said, ‘Oh, you’re looking like a stud.’ ”\n\nTrish Gatley, 74, said she was visiting a friend on the 10th floor at the time of the shooting. Unaware of what had happened, she walked downstairs to her ninth-floor apartment to grab her purse before work.\n\nTwo officers carrying guns told her to put her hands up, she said. They told her to stay calm and continue down the stairs. When she exited the building, she said she saw a man on the ground, as well as an injured woman being stabilized and put onto a stretcher.Evacuated residents were kept warm and dry in a C-Tran bus at Sixth and Washington streets. Some residents who sheltered in place looked down from their windows on the crowd gathering below. Law enforcement cordoned off a three-block radius around Smith Tower, with police vehicles bumper to bumper on surrounding streets. Area C-Tran bus routes were detoured during the response.\n\nPolice kept the area of Fifth and Sixth streets from Main to Washington streets closed for several hours after taking Breck into custody. Following a final sweep of the building, residents were given clearance to return to their apartments.\n\n“While we are still learning about what happened surrounding the shooting incident this afternoon in downtown Vancouver, our hearts go out to the victims and their families as they deal with this tragedy,” Vancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle said in a written statement. “I commend our police officers, fire and EMS personnel who quickly responded to the scene. I have the utmost confidence in our officers as they work to resolve the situation.”SHOOTING TIMELINE\nA man was killed and two women were injured Thursday afternoon in a shooting at Smith Tower Apartments in downtown Vancouver. The shooting prompted a roughly 2½-hour standoff.\n\nThe following is a summary of communications between emergency officials from emergency radio traffic monitored at The Columbian.\n\n2:09 p.m.\n\n•  Vancouver police officers are dispatched to Smith Tower, 515 Washington St., for a report of a disturbance with a weapon.\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\n•  Vancouver Fire Department and medical crews are dispatched amid reports of a shooting with multiple victims. A triage area is set up to receive victims.\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\n•  Residents shelter in place on the 13th floor.\n\n•  The suspect in the shooting, Robert E. Breck, 80, is confirmed to be alone inside his apartment on the 13th floor. In a phone call with negotiators, he says he is willing to surrender and doesn’t want to hurt anyone else.\n\n•  A C-Tran bus stages at Esther Short Park to evacuate residents.\n\n•  The tower is cleared up to the 11th floor.\n\n•  Two patients are taken to PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center.\n\n•  An officer requests that power be shut off on the 13th floor and that elevators are stopped.\n\n•  A negotiator says they are speaking with Breck about the surrender process.\n\n•  Breck hangs up, and a negotiator notes that the man is in the bathroom of the apartment.\n\n•  An officer says that anyone still inside their rooms may shelter in place and stay away from openings.\n\n•  An officer requests a door charge in case an explosive breach is necessary.\n\n•  Breck exits the front door of the apartment, refuses officer commands and re-enters.\n\n•  Officers want Breck to crawl out of the apartment on hands and knees. But the man claims he has a sickness “similar to Lou Gehrig’s disease,” making that difficult.\n\n•  An officer notes that police have probable cause for murder.\n\n•  Officers say that, when he surrenders, Breck should remove his shirt to ensure he is unarmed.\n\n•  Breck exits the apartment again, but he didn’t feel comfortable with the exchange and returns.

They are asked to leave.\n\n•  An ambulance is requested to stage outside the tower in case “any more patients are produced.”\n\n4:17 p.m.\n\n•  Evacuated residents are boarded onto a C-Tran bus. They are checked for injuries as they board.\n\n•  Negotiators note they are “working on some anxiety issues” with Breck.\n\n4:23 p.m.\n\n•  A door to the apartment suddenly opens. Moments later, Breck is in custody.\n\n4:26 p.m.\n\n•  Police enter the apartment to search for additional victims.\n\n•  Breck is led down an elevator and taken to a police vehicle.\n\n4:29 p.m.\n\n•  Breck’s apartment is cleared.

    "content": "Santiago – Chile has been gripped by protests against high living costs and inequality for nearly two weeks. \n\nAngry over President Sebastian Pinera‘s response to the protests, demonstrators are calling for him to step down. Although the country is no longer under a state of emergency, which was initially declared after the demonstrations began, protests have continued, with frequent clashes between police and protesters. Police have used tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and pellets, prompting allegations of rights abuses.\n\nLooting has also taken place and supermarkets and petrol stations have been set on fire.\n\nAt least 20 civilians have been killed, according to officials.\n\nIt is the worst violence the country has witnessed since the 17-year-long military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, which ended in 1990.\n\nDespite the unrest, the majority of protesters have been peaceful, with many banging spoons against cooking pots – a form of protest known as cacerolazo.\n\nAs the protests continue, Al Jazeera examines the underlying reasons behind the protests in what is considered one of South America’s most stable countries.\n\n1. How did the protests start, and who was behind them?\nThe protests began as a student-led demonstration against transport fares.\n\nIn early October, the government announced that the metro rush hour prices would rise by 30 pesos ($0.04).\n\nResponding to public outcry against the rising fare, then-Minister of Economy Juan Andres Fontaine announced that those upset with the price rise could wake up earlier and pay a lower rate.\n\n“When the costs rise, there are not many options,” he said at the time.\n\nOutrage grew after the remarks, leading students to conduct a mass fare evasion by jumping over the metro turnstiles, and, in some instances, destroying them.\n\n“Evade, and not pay, is another way of fighting,” they chanted at the time. According to Victor Villegas, a sociologist at Santiago’s Alberto Hurtado University, “it’s not a coincidence” that the movement began with high school students because “they have always driven Chilean social movements”.\n\n“Since the dictatorship, they have been involved in political movements, and this time again, they again took the baton and started the protests,” he said.\n\nAs police attempted to stop the students at the stations with force, the protests spilled out into the streets.\n\nMetro stations, supermarkets, and petrol stations were burned, leading the president to declare a state of emergency.2. Are the protests still about the metro prices?\nThe anger goes far beyond the cost of transport.\n\nChileans are also frustrated with the increasing cost of living, low wages and pensions, a lack of education rights, a poor public health system and crippling inequality.\n\n“The 30 cents ($0.04) were just the tip of the iceberg,” said Jacinta Urivi, a 29-year-old publicist who has been taken part in the street protests since they began.\n\n“We don’t have good public health, the salaries are low – there are so many things that act against the people, that they (the politicians) fill their pockets with. I am proud and happy that people are waking up,” Urivi told Al Jazeera.According to Jose Miguel Ahumada, a political economist and associate professor at the University of Chile, the country is “one of the most unequal countries in Latin America”. \n\n“Highly unequal societies invest less in human capital, invest less in education, and produce more social problems,” he said. \n\n3. What are the protesters demands?\nThe protesters’ demands vary, but many have called for a change to the pension system and an increase of the minimum wage in addition to Pinera’s resignation. Although Pinera has addressed both in his reform plans, protesters are frustrated that his proposals come at a cost to the state, rather than to the private industries. \n\nPinera’s brother, Jose Pinera, is the mastermind of the current privatised pension system, which was introduced during the dictatorship. There are calls to completely change model to a more social scheme. \n\nThere are also demands for a new constitution, as the current one was introduced in the dictatorship. \n\n “We want a constitutional assembly to write a new constitution” says Iraci Hassler, a Santiago councilwoman. “One that prioritises the lives of human beings above private property” 4. What has been Pinera’s response?\nResponding to the protests, Pinera initially declared a state of emergency, which allowed for the suspension of certain freedoms, including movement and assembly. It also meant military forces were deployed to the streets and curfews were enforced. \n\nMany criticised Pinera’s decision to declare the state of emergency so quickly, without addressing the public first.\n\nHe justified the decision, saying he wanted to maintain public order against vandals and crime.\n\nBut after a mass protest on Friday, which saw more than one million people rally in cities across the country, Pinera opted for a more positive approach.\n\n“We are all listening and understanding,” he said in a statement. \n\nHe lifted the state of emergency on Sunday, and a day later he replaced eight of his cabinet members, including the minister of the economy and Andres Chadwick, Pinera’s cousin and minister of internal affairs, who called protesters “criminals”.  \n\nThe unpopular education, health and transport ministers were kept in their positions, however. The new ministers were also criticised for having little experience.\n\nPinera has also proposed new social reforms, including a rise in the minimum wage, an increase in the state pension and the stabilisation of the costs of electricity. \n\nAlthough some welcomed the reforms, others said they did not go far enough. \n\n“The state continues paying, without touching the profits of the companies,” said Hassler, the councilwoman. “There’s a problem that the right wing are not understanding.”\n\nChile was set to host the APEC trade summit next month, and the climate change summit COP25 in December, but Pinera backed out of the events on Wednesday, saying he had to prioritise “re-establishing public order”.\n\n5. How many people have died? How many have been arrested?\nVideos have surfaced on social media showing the military and police hitting, shooting and running over civilians on the street.\n\nOfficials have said that 20 people have died as a result of the unrest, including 11 who died in arson attempts, looting and rioting and five who were killed by military officials.On Tuesday, the National Institute of Human Rights (INDH) said more than 1,233 civilians had gone to hospital with injuries from the unrest. At least 688 of those injured had wounds caused by weapons, according to the institute. Thousands have also been arrested. \n\nUN investigators arrived in the country on Monday after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for an independent investigation into the deaths and “disturbing allegations” of excessive force used on protesters. \n\nPinera welcomed the investigators, saying “we have nothing to hide”. \n\nSergio Micco, the head of the INDH, criticised the police after one of his team members was shot seven times by metal pellets on Tuesday.\n\n“It’s fine for the police to harshly confronts the looting, but they must respect demonstrations that are carried out peacefully,” he said. \n\nResponding to the criticism, the director of the Chilean police said protesters “want to criminalise us because we are fulfilling a constitutional mandate to restore public order”. He also emphasised that many allegations of abuse have yet to be properly investigated. \n\n6. Is there any sign of the unrest calming?\nPinera’s concessions have so far failed to satisfy protesters, with many vowing to stay in the streets until he steps down. \n\nGreater reforms for social services will have to be introduced if the government hopes to ease any tensions going forward, according to analysts.\n\n“Chileans feel like they are losing public participation” in political decision making, Villegas, the sociologist, said. “That they are treated as subjects of consumerism more than people with rights.”",

    "content": "For the past three years, Alicia Soto has traveled back to the city where her life was changed forever.\n\nThe emotional scars from the Route 91 Harvest music festival mass shooting have not fully healed, but Soto said that attending the 1 October Sunrise Remembrance Ceremony every year has helped her process her trauma. On Thursday, the 42-year-old was one of about 200 people wearing face masks and standing 6 feet apart in the Clark County Government Center’s outdoor amphitheater for the ceremony.\n\n“That night I lost a part of me, and I come back looking for it,” Soto said, with tears in her eyes.\n\nSince October 2017, Soto has moved from California to Minneapolis and has started her dream job as a flight attendant. She said that she decided to “live life to the fullest” for those who died in the attack.\n\nA slideshow during the ceremony displayed the names and pictures of the 58 people killed that night. The pictures of two women who died within the past year of injuries they suffered in the mass shooting were included at the end with a message reading, “In Memoriam of 1 October Victims Lost in the Last Year.”At the end of the ceremony, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced that the two women, Kimberly Gervais of Mira Loma, California, and Samanta Arjune of Las Vegas, will be added to the official death toll, raising the number from 58 to 60.\n\nThe announcement came after the Review-Journal on Monday published an article that highlighted their deaths and reported the Metropolitan Police Department’s initial decision not to include them in the death total.“It isn’t like we’re trying to avoid the names,” Lombardo said in a brief interview after the ceremony. He later added that, “At this point, I think I’m comfortable in acknowledging that the other two individuals lost their lives as a result of 1 October.”\n\nThere were fewer people at the ceremony this year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced officials to limit the number of people who could attend. Gov. Steve Sisolak, who also addressed the crowd, said that when he raised the limit on public gatherings this week, Thursday’s event was one of his “biggest priorities.”Sisolak’s voice grew shaky as he recalled that night and offered his condolences to the family members of those who died.\n\n“We will never, never forget what happened that day, or the lives that were lost, and the lives that were changed,” he said.\n\nAlbert Rivera, the father of Jordyn Rivera, who was 21 when she was killed in the attack, said he was thankful to all the survivors who continue to come together on the anniversary and support each other.\n\n“We are all a statistic — we are all part of this unwanted fraternity we didn’t chose to be a part of,” he said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged Greg Zanis, an Illinois carpenter who built 58 crosses honoring those who died in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Zanis died in May of terminal bladder cancer, and Rivera said he will “be forever changed” by Zanis’ kindness.\n\nHe ended his remarks by calling for unity during what he said has been a time of divisiveness in the U.S. He urged people to remember how they came together on Oct. 2, 2017.\n\n“It’s said that it takes more effort to hate than to love. Let’s remember that,” he said. “Until we meet again — here, there or in the air — may we all smile like Jordyn.”",

    "content": "The Azerbaijani government is pushing forward with an ambitious plan to reconstruct the territories that it recently won from Armenia, many of which have been virtually leveled since Azerbaijan lost control of them in the 1990s.\n\nPresident Ilham Aliyev highlighted the reconstruction plans during a November 16 tour of some of the territories along with his wife and first vice president, Mehriban Aliyeva.\n\n“A new master plan will be drawn up. Relevant instructions have been given. A master plan will be developed for each city. All office buildings, public buildings, schools and medical centers will be established here. All infrastructure will be put in place. Streets, parks and alleys will be built. Victory monuments will be erected in all the cities and life will return here,” Aliyev said during a visit to Jabrayil.\n\nThe government has not said how much it intends to spend on all of this. Independent economists have estimated the costs in the tens of billions of dollars; Azerbaijan’s annual state budget is currently about $15 billion.\n\nEconomist Togrul Valiyev told Eurasianet that fully reconstructing the newly retaken territories would likely take 10 years and cost 25 billion manats (about $15 billion). \n\n“There is basically no infrastructure left in Jabrayil, Fuzuli, Zangilan, and Gubadly,” four of the seven regions that Azerbaijan regained control of, Valiyev said. “It’s going to cost about as much as Azerbaijan spends in a year” on its entire budget, he said. \n\nAzerbaijan will also likely try to attract private financing for the reconstruction. “Many entrepreneurs, natives of these regions, will probably want to invest in the reconstruction of industrial and commercial enterprises in their villages and towns and may even offer some donations,” said Avaz Hasanov, the head of the NGO Humanitarian Research Public Union, in an interview with news website Caucasian Knot. \n\nSo far the government has only given small hints of the cost of reconstruction.\n\nDuring his visit to Jabrayil, Aliyev announced that a new road would be built from Fuzuli, on the far eastern end of the newly retaken territories, to Shusha, the key Azerbaijani city in the region. Following the visit he announced that the government was allocating 50 million manats ($29 million) for the 101.5-kilometer road linking Ahmadbeyli (in territory that Azerbaijan had already controlled) through Fuzuli to Shusha. Other plans for new transportation links also have been announced: roads in the region of Talish and Sugovushan (which the Azerbaijani government renamed from the Armenian Madaghis shortly after retaking it early in the war) were already being reconstructed in late October, local media reported. The cost for that reconstruction has not been announced.\n\nAzerbaijan’s state railway company also has announced plans to rebuild the rail line connecting Yevlakh, in territory that Azerbaijan had already controlled, into Karabakh all the way to Khankendi (the city Armenians call Stepanakert). This is particularly aspirational, given that Armenian forces still control much of this territory, including Stepanakert. \n\nWork in the newly retaken territories is being undertaken under a decree that Aliyev signed on October 29, setting up temporary special administrations in the territories. Temporary commandant offices are being established in each district and Ehsan Zahidov, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said they will be headed by local police chiefs. \n\nVarious government bodies then began expanding their operations into the region. The State Security Service and Ministry of Emergency Situations announced that they had set up local structures. The Ministry of Internal Affairs said that it had moved the Shusha police department into Shusha; it had been previously located in the Terter region.\n\nThe Ministry of Emergency Situations has taken control of the Sugovushan reservoir, in the Terter region. That will help Azerbaijan take partial control of the waters from the critical Sarsang reservoir, and ameliorate serious water shortages that the country has been suffering. \n\n“Until now, we never knew whether we could get water from the Sarsang reservoir or not,” Valiyev said. “Now we will be able to use the system normally.”\n\nThe government also has sought to open up mining in the newly retaken territories. A consortium between the state enterprise Azergold and a (yet unnamed) foreign company has been formed to mine for gold in the regions of Zangilan, Vezhnali, and Kelbajar, said Tahir Mirkishli, a member of parliament. “The consortium has said that they are ready to start excavation works in the liberated territories as soon as they are demined,” Mirkishli told a November 18 meeting at the Azerbaijan State Economic University dedicated to Karabakh’s future economic plans. \n\nThe rush to enter the newly retaken territories has not been limited to government bodies. Several banks announced that they plan to open branches across the region. \n\n“Opening Pasha Bank’s branch in Shusha, we will support the state in the implementation of initiatives aimed at reintegrating the liberated lands,” said the chairman of Pasha Bank, which is owned by First Lady Aliyeva’s family.\n\nCultural institutions, too, are rushing to reenter the territories. The State Tourism Agency is working on creating tourist routes in the region. And officials are even exploring the possibility of holding the 2021 version of Turkvision, an international song contest for the Turkic world, in Shusha.",

    "content": "Beirut, Lebanon – At least 73 people have been killed and nearly 4,000 wounded in a powerful explosion that ripped through Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, leaving much of it a wrangled mess.\n\nThe massive explosion on Tuesday at Beirut’s port sent shockwaves across the city, causing widespread damage to buildings and shattering windows even on the outskirts of the capital. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. Officials linked the explosion to some 2,700 tonnes of confiscated ammonium nitrate that were being stored in a warehouse at the port for six years.\n\nPrime Minsiter Hassan Diab promised that “what happened will not go without accountability”.\n\nHealth Minister Hamad Hassan called for international aid to Lebanon, and a number of nations in the West and the Gulf have said they were willing to provide assistance.The explosion left the port a wasteland; cars hanging from the mangled beams of warehouses, bent containers spread across roadways and a large ship listing onto the quayside. A health worker on the scene told Al Jazeera that he had seen at least 10 people dead near the explosion site, many left disfigured.\n\nHelicopters circling the port area were trying to extinguish a large fire. Sirens filled the air.\n\nHospitals in the city were overwhelmed with wounded and turning those with non-serious injuries away.\n\nAt Hotel-Dieu hospital, itself left damaged by the explosion, dozens of people trying to enter were told to go elsewhere. “It’s a catastrophe, a catastrophe,” a man said in disbelief.\n\nInside the crowded lobby, a family got the news that their relative was dead. A young woman bent over in anguish, spread her arms open to an infant child and said “Youssef, dad is in heaven.” An old man fell to his knees and smacked the ground, over and over.\n\nPharmacies in the city were asked to welcome the wounded in order to take pressure off hospitals.\n\nOn TV screens, doctors asked for people to come donate blood. Newscasters read out the names of missing people – some were port employees, others were firefighters who had first responded to the fire at the port, before the massive explosion ripped the capital apart.\n\n“Joseph Ruukoz,” the newscaster read. “Marwan Chartouni. Charbel Hitti. Mohammad Mustafa Dakdouki. An Ethiopian woman.”\n\nEarlier at the port, a man in the all-white uniform of a boat crew, stained with blood, wandered near an Italian ship docked near the explosion site, the Orient Queen. Its interior was blown out, it was sloped sideways onto the quayside.\n\n“The ship is totally destroyed – the cabins, the lounge, everything,” Vincenco Orlandini, the 69-year-old Italian crew member, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“I heard the blast and I flew to the opposite of the lobby, then I landed on the carpet and I’m lucky, I think that saved me.”Video of the explosion taken by Al Jazeera shows a large column of smoke billowing from an area of the port that houses large warehouses before a large orange explosion is seen and huge dome-shaped blast wave shoots into the air. \n\nGlass storefronts and windowpanes across the city were shattered in the explosion, while videos and pictures shared on social media showed doors ripped from their hinges and ceilings filled with gaping holes.\n\nA civil defence worker who has worked in the sector for 20 years was in disbelief at the scale of the damage.\n\n“I’ve seen the assassinations and the explosions but this is something else. There is something wrong here,” the worker said.\n\nThe explosion in Beirut port comes as the country faces an unprecedented financial crisis and a surging coronavirus outbreak.\n\nLocated in the heart of capital, the port is a vital piece of infrastructure used to get scarce goods in the country. There explosion damaged grains silos in the port which are a strategic reserve of wheat for the crisis-hit nation.",

Holiday parks and visitor centres were evacuated into Friday night and while the extent of damage to infrastructure isn't known, Mr Pengilly is worried about what will be revealed.\n\n\"To have an island more or less half burnt is unbelievable.\"\n\nThe South Australian Country Fire Service (CFS) issued an extreme fire danger warning early Saturday morning for the Ravine fire on the western end of Kangaroo Island, which said the fire \"increased considerably\" yesterday.\n\nThe fires are at a Watch and Act message.\n\nMr Pengilly said conditions were mild on the island this morning and there was even some light rain, but the CFS warns the fire remains a threat as the conditions are continually changing.\n\nLocal MP Leon Bignell said it had been a long night for those on the island, with people camped out on the Kingscote Oval and others taking shelter in a school gymnasium. He said locals who fled the fire would be looking for information from authorities on when they might return to their properties.\n\n“People over here are in shock, they’re scared, they’re frightened,” Mr Bignell told ABC radio.The Country Fire Service urged people to defer all non-essential travel to Kangaroo Island. Ferry services to Kangaroo Island will operate as scheduled today, but priority will be given to fire vehicles and personnel.\n\nKangaroo Island Mayor Michael Pengilly said part of the island looked like it had been hit by a \"nuclear bomb\".\n\n\"It has been absolutely devastating,\" Mr Pengilly told the ABC, \"... the north coast looks like it has been hit by a nuclear bomb.\"\n\n\"Flinders Chase is going to come out of this badly.

Nearly four in five cases involved people vaping products with THC, alone or with nicotine. \n\n\"We really have the feeling right now that there might be a lot of different, nasty things in e-cigarette or vaping products,\" Schuchat said.\n\nThe latest survey found that 70% of the lung injury cases involved males and 37% were from users under 21 years of age. The median age of those who died was 49.5, but even young vapers might face long-term injuries, Schuchat said. \n\n\"These are really serious injuries in the lungs and we don't know how well people will recover from them, whether lung damage may be permanent,\" she said. While the CDC said the cause of the illnesses is still under investigation, the Mayo Clinic study says the cause may be \"toxic chemical fumes.\"\n\nThe findings, published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, were based on the biopsies of 17 people with confirmed or possible cases of vaping-related lung injuries, including two patients who died.\n\nAll of the subjects had a history of vaping; 71% of them used marijuana or cannabis oils.Schuchat said the Mayo Clinic study is \"quite  helpful\" but that the probe into the causes is still in its \"early days.\"Early symptoms of the lung injuries include coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pains, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nDespite speculation by some researchers that the injuries might be linked to an accumulation in the lungs of fatty substances known as lipids, the Mayo Clinic study says none of the cases showed any evidence of lipoid pneumonia.\n\n\"While we can't discount the potential role of lipids, we have not seen anything to suggest this is a problem caused by lipid accumulation in the lungs,\" said Brandon Larsen, a surgical pathologist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the senior author of the study, in a statement. \"Instead, it seems to be some kind of direct chemical injury, similar to what one might see with exposures to toxic chemical fumes, poisonous gases and toxic agents.\"Studies have shown that products containing THC or other cannabis oils, such as cannabidiol or CBD, may play a role in the outbreak.\"This is a public health crisis, and a lot of people are working frantically around the clock to find out what the culprit or culprits could be – and what chemicals may be responsible,\" Larsen said. \"Based on what we have seen in our study, we suspect that most cases involve chemical contaminants, toxic byproducts or other noxious agents within vape liquids.\"\n\nLast week, Massachusetts announced a four-month ban on all vaping devices and flavors. Michigan, New York and Rhode Island have moved to restrict flavoring for the devices, also known as e-cigarettes. Cities such as San Francisco banned the sale and distribution of vaping devices.\n\nIn a related report, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics said a survey found that from 2014 to 2018, the percentage of adults 18-24 who smoked cigarettes decreased from 16.7% to 7.8%.\n\nThe percentage of adults in this age group who used electronic cigarettes increased from 5.1% to 7.6%, according to the survey.",

Another 31 people were injured.\n\nMr O'Prey's father Ian said he was \"really angry\" at the inquiry's findings and that Capt Traill had been made \"a fall guy\".\n\nThe Clutha's owner, Alan Crossan, also expressed \"shock and disappointment\" at the report and how \"brutal\" it had been towards Capt Traill.\n\nHe said questions remained over the reasons why the pilot had ignored the low fuel warnings.During the fatal accident inquiry, Sheriff Turnbull heard testimony from families, experts and eyewitnesses.\n\nIn his findings, he said there was \"no doubt\" that the crash had happened because the helicopter's engines \"flamed out\" due to a lack of fuel.\n\nThe fuel supply tanks had been depleted because Capt Traill had failed to ensure that at least one of the aircraft's fuel transfer pump switches was on.\n\n\"The central question for the inquiry is why did that happen?\" said Sheriff Turnbull.\n\n\"The answer is a simple one. Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received.\"He said the accident would not have happened if the pilot had followed the normal procedure for dealing with low fuel warnings.\n\nThe Pilot's Checklist stipulated that he should land the aircraft within 10 minutes of a fuel warning.\n\nThe sheriff described Capt Traill's failure to follow that procedure as \"inexplicable\".\n\nHe said: \"Capt Traill took a chance that the low fuel warnings he received were erroneous.\n\n\"That was a conscious decision on his part. It was a decision that had fatal consequences for 10 people.\"Sheriff Turnbull also said that the Eurocopter EC135, manufactured by Airbus, should have had a visible and audible warning which would activate when both fuel transfer pumps had been switched off.\n\nThe pumps, which were both switched off during the flight, supplied fuel from the main tank to the helicopter's twin engines.\n\nSheriff Turnbull said: \"The circumstances of the accident are so unusual that it is improbable they will be repeated, even without the introduction of the safety actions taken since the accident.\"\n\nHe added that the tragedy \"changed forever the lives of many people\" and praised the dignity of those who attended the 32-day inquiry.Sheriff Turnbull noted it was \"surprising\" that it took two years from the 2015 publication of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report on the crash to confirm that there would be no criminal proceedings.\n\nHe added: \"It took far too long to lodge a notice of inquiry in this case.\"\n\nSheriff Turnbull also said the Crown Office's Helicopter Incidents Investigation Team were \"not sufficiently resourced\" to enable the FAI to start sooner.\n\nHe added that an FAI into the deaths caused by the Sumburgh helicopter crash in August 2013 was still to be held.\n\n'Deeply saddened'\nA Crown Office spokesperson said: \"This was an exceptionally complex and challenging investigation and the Crown acknowledges that the time taken from the tragedy occurring to convening the inquiry was longer than desirable, and that this compounded the distress suffered by bereaved relatives.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said additional funding had been made available to recruit additional staff, and that improvements were being made.\n\nA spokesman for the aircraft's manufacturer, Airbus Helicopters, said it was \"deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the heavy loss of life\".\n\n\"We took immediate action to understand the root cause and we have taken note of the findings of both the AAIB and FAI,\" he said.\n\n\"The safety of our fleet remains our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything possible to ensure the safe operation of our helicopters.\"\n\nClutha timeline29 November 2013: A police helicopter crashes onto the Clutha bar in Glasgow, killing 10 people\n9 December 2013: AAIB preliminary report finds no evidence of a \"major\" engine or gearbox failure, and says there was 95 litres of fuel on board the aircraft\n14 February 2014: An AAIB special report finds both engines \"flamed out\" but does not pinpoint the cause\n23 October 2015: The AAIB's final report finds the main cause of accident to be mismanagement of the fuel system by the pilot\n24 November 2017: Fatal accident inquiry announced\n8 April 2019: Fatal accident inquiry begins at Hampden Stadium in Glasgow",

    "content": "BUNIA, Democratic Republic of Congo — It’s the evening before Easter when I meet them outside the Mudzi Maria Health Center. The sky is shifting from ochre to lavender and a choir’s voices soar from the nearby Catholic cathedral. For roughly the next half hour, the faithful offer up the triple chant of “Alleluia, a-llelu-ya, a-leh-heh-luuu-uuu-yah” — ancient argot for “Praise the Lord.”\n\nAcross from me sit three generations of women. Jesinne Dhewedza is the oldest, and like many in the region from her generation, she has no idea how old she actually is. Dhewedza doesn’t — maybe can’t — say what the men with machetes who fell upon her village late one night did to her, but her wizened hands tell part of the story. Two weeks ago, she had 10 fingers. Now she has six.\n\nPraise the Lord.\n\nIrene Mave is the youngest of the three. She’s wearing a striped polo shirt, a striped skirt, and an almost vacant stare. She knows how old she is. Before the attack, she could have held up six fingers, one for each year of her life in Logo Takpa, a farming village where the roofs are made of thatch. She can’t do that anymore. Two weeks ago, the men with machetes took her right arm.\n\nPraise the Lord.\n\nThe third woman is Marie Dz’dza, Dhewedza’s daughter and Irene Mave’s aunt. Her hair is close-cropped, her frame slender and willowy. Plastic rosary beads the color of a robin’s egg hang around her neck. Two weeks ago, she had five children. Now, because of the men with machetes, she has four. Two weeks ago, she was a farmer, coaxing food from the soil. She harvested manioc with her two calloused hands. The men with machetes took those, too.\n\nPraise the Lord.\n\nThe mysterious campaign of violence that swept through Djugu territory in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Ituri province, affecting hundreds of thousands of the area’s people, began last December. The wave of terror crested in late February and early March as village after village — sometimes more than one per day — came under attack by men armed with pangas, axes, bows and arrows, and spears. In all, about 120 communities were attacked, according to the United Nations. Hundreds were killed and thousands of homes were destroyed.\n\n“This may be genocide.”\nThere are many contending theories about the sudden surge in violence, but its outcome was unmistakable: an ethnic cleansing campaign was underway . Ituri’s minority ethnic group, the Hema, were driven from their homes by armed men — some of them their neighbors — mostly from the Lendu community. The destruction was so widespread that it could be seen from outer space and so merciless that some in the region worried the Hema weren’t just being driven from their homeland but being obliterated as a people. “This may be genocide,” Hadji Ruhingwa Bamaraki, president of the Hema community’s cultural association, told me at the time.\n\nMore than 350,000 Iturians were displaced by the violence — including more than 50,000 who fled across Lake Albert to neighboring Uganda. It was as if the entire population of St. Louis, Pittsburgh, or Cincinnati were forced into exile.\n\nMore from this project\nLearn about how we reported this story\nRead the survivors in their own words\nWhat happened in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this year was a slaughter in silence. The wave of massacres was ignored by the world, and the humanitarian crisis that followed was amplified by international neglect. The Trump administration’s “America First” agenda played no small part in this disaster; an abrupt change to U.S. support for peacekeeping efforts in 2017 contributed to the constellation of catastrophes that enabled hundreds of machete-wielding militiamen to kill with impunity and cause immense suffering to hundreds of thousands of women, children and men.\n\nThe massacres and the mass exodus from rural Djugu barely registered outside the region. There were no tense debates about it on the United Nations’ General Assembly floor, no stern warnings from the White House, no drumbeat of stories leading the nightly network broadcasts or breathless debate on the 24-hour cable news outlets.\n\nFrom February to April, I spoke with more than 300 people — including community leaders, current and former government officials, soldiers and high-ranking military officers, activists, analysts, U.N. officials, and aid workers. But the vast majority of my time was spent talking to witnesses and survivors of the violence, like Marie Dz’dza, Jesinne Dhewedza, and Irene Mave. Through my interviews with witnesses and survivors, I corroborated attacks on 31 villages. Community leaders, local journalists, human rights activists, and internally displaced persons (IDPs) provided information on nearly 62 more massacres that fit the pattern of attacks.\n\nTheir stories and the destruction that I witnessed in their villages, and the shortfalls in aid that I saw firsthand in DRC and Uganda, showed in vivid detail what happens when the world averts its gaze from a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nThe violence in Logo Takpa was typical of the rolling wave of massacres that emptied Djugu territory. Late one night in March, Lendu men wielding machetes and bows and arrows came screaming out of the darkness into the village. Half-blind and slow of foot, Jesinne Dhewedza couldn’t join her neighbors as they ran. Being a good daughter, Marie Dz’dza didn’t run either. “My mother couldn’t flee, so I had to figure out some way to keep her safe,” she tells me.\n\nA short time later, Dz’dza attempted to sneak out of the village with her mother in tow. It didn’t take long for a group of armed Lendu men to spot them. She knew all of these men. They shared the same marketplace, a collection of wooden stalls along the main road where people bought and sold beans and greens, cassava, and maize flour. She had watched them grow up.\n\nJesinne Dhewedza, unable to see clearly and size up the situation, scolded the young men. Dz’dza tried to quiet her. “Mama, don’t shout at them. You have to pray for us,” she pleaded. Then one of the men swung his panga and hit Dz’dza in the head, broadside, knocking her unconscious.\n\nDz’dza woke some time later, her head in a haze, the ground beneath her sticky-wet. Then came the pain. She looked at her arms, the source of her agony. The sleeves of her dress were sliced, hanging by threads and soaked in blood. “I was sure this was the end of my life,” she tells me.\n\nNo one came to rescue Dz’dza. She was hardly unique. In rural eastern Congo, you’re mostly on your own. There are no aid groups out in the countryside. There’s no ambulance to call. The police run away from attacks.\n\nShe was discovered by soldiers patrolling the village almost two days later, she told me. They drove her to the nearest medical center. “That’s when I realized I had lost them,” Dz’dza says, gesturing toward me with the stumps that remain.\n\nHer dress sleeves were all that had held her lower arms in place.\n\nThere are no easy explanations for the carnage in Djugu nor for the sudden cessation of massacres in mid-March, although violence — crop destruction, kidnappings, and killings — continues on a lesser scale. Most experts, analysts, and the displaced themselves point to what they call an “invisible hand” — powerful politico-military forces working with local and national power brokers or exiled politicians to drive the Hema community from the region.\n\nThough they lack concrete evidence, many Congolese posit that President Joseph Kabila, whose legal mandate expired two years ago, or his allies, orchestrated the attacks in an effort to destabilize Ituri as a pretext to postpone national elections that are scheduled for this December. Many point to the fact that violence erupted just as Corneille Nangaa, the head of the electoral commission, stated that conflict in Ituri’s Djugu territory could prevent the government from holding polls in 2018. This “strategy of chaos” has been successfully employed before, Ida Sawyer, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, told me. “Basically, you create violence in a pocket of the country to such a large degree that it can be used as an excuse for further election delays and another reason for Kabila to hang onto power.” The office of interior minister and deputy prime minister did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.\n\nThe motives behind the violence remain murky, but the sheer brutality was clear. Photographs of the dead show heads cleaved almost in half or hacked off completely. Skulls were shattered, genitals amputated. Corpses were so grotesquely mutilated that they disorient the mind. I traveled between hospitals and medical centers and IDP camps, speaking with the injured and the traumatized. I met toddlers whose faces were split by machetes. There was the elderly woman with the shattered arm who had been shot in the face with an arrow. The little girl whose head the attackers tried to hack off. The 11-year-old who lost a hand. The man missing a chunk of his calf, which he said the militiamen tried to force him to eat.\n\nI met several other men who lay in hospital beds, glassy-eyed with fixed expressions, and swaddled in blood-stained bandages, their frames curled up as much as their injuries would allow, as if their entire bodies were wincing. They looked like they expected to be struck at any moment. Many couldn’t manage to speak about what they survived. Women were reportedly gang-raped during the attacks or sexually assaulted while fleeing. Ten percent of Congolese child refugees in Uganda said they were raped during their journey, according to an assessment by Save the Children.\n\nPerhaps worse was the profound neglect of survivors by Congo’s national government and the international community. Clinics and medical centers lacked the drugs to treat patients and even the printed forms needed to transport them to hospitals that might. Refugees found themselves not just homeless but hungry and lacking sufficient supplies of water. Camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) were short of food. Mothers with young children crammed into overcrowded group tents or slept outdoors for weeks at a time. Those outside the camps fared even worse and were forced to rely on the kindness of family or strangers.\n\nAs the sky melts from lilac to plum, Marie Dz’dza tells me her family is just barely getting by with the assistance of the Catholic relief organization Caritas. Jesinne Dhewedza sits almost catatonic most of the time, murmuring just a few words now and again. Irene Mave goes through bouts of silence, too. They all require regular care for their wounds, not to mention the basic necessities of life. Neither is assured.\n\n“Don’t even bother mentioning the government.”\nSister Angele, who runs the health center, says her team is doing their best but admits the staff is overwhelmed, with about 9,000 IDPs now living in a camp down the road. “We didn’t expect all these patients at one time. We need basic equipment and supplies — more beds, tables, an X-ray machine, medications,” she says. There are no services. There is no assistance. There is no money. “Don’t even bother mentioning the government,” she says, shaking her head.\n\n“Congo matatizo” is the phrase in Swahili. Congo problems.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2: NO RESCUE\nViolence of the type that left Marie Dz’dza maimed dates back to the late 19th century, when Belgium’s King Leopold II seized the vast territory surrounding the Congo River — the infamous setting of Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness.” Leopold’s army looted Congo’s rubber, brutalized its people, and presided over a terror campaign that saw baskets of amputated hands presented to white officers in the service of the king. Murder and famine, disease and displacement took a heavy toll. Congo’s population was cut in half, to just 10 million, during King Leopold’s fin de siècle holocaust.\n\nMillions more would die a century later during what came to be known as Africa’s World War, a conflict that raged from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s. Forty armed groups operated in eastern Congo alone, and more than 5 million people died of direct violence or its fallout — hunger, starvation, illness.\n\nIn Ituri, disputes between Hema pastoralists and Lendu farmers became enmeshed in the web of local, national, and regional conflict. By early 2000, months of fighting had left almost 7,000 dead and led to a “humanitarian catastrophe” in Ituri, according to Human Rights Watch. Between 1999 and 2003, an estimated 55,000 people were killed in the province and 500,000 were forced to flee their homes. The region was dubbed the “bloodiest corner” of Congo.\n\nMore from this project\nLearn about how we reported this story\nRead the survivors in their own words\nToday, on a planet awash with conflict and displacement — 68.5 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced by the end of 2017 — the crises in Democratic Republic of Congo still rank among the most profound. There is no shortage of violence and unrest in the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, and Tanganyika, in the Kasai region and even the capital, Kinshasa, where anti-government protests have been brutally suppressed.\n\n“The violence started with incredible speed and seemed, for many in the region, to come out of nowhere.”\nThe 350,000 people who fled Ituri this past spring joined 6.8 million internally displaced Congolese and 552,000 Congolese refugees spread across sub-Saharan Africa. More than 2 million Congolese fled their homes last year alone, close to three times the number of Rohingya made homeless by an ethnic cleansing campaign in Myanmar. In 2018, there were 13 million Congolese in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, the same number as in Syria.\n\nIturi is no longer the bloodiest corner of Congo, but the violence there in recent months was as severe and merciless as the slaughters at the turn of the 20th century, the 21st century, and almost anytime or anywhere in the world.\n\nATTACKS ON VILLAGES THAT VICE NEWS WAS ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY*\nAngolouBlukwaBuleCiteDhendroDiiJooKafeKakwaKasenyiKawaKparnganzaKpi KpiLogo TakpaLoviMarifaMazeMetuNyamambaRetaRuleSalaSbiiSombosaSombusoSongamayaTalegaTaraTcheTcheleTchomia\n*Vice News was able to independently corroborate 31 village attacks. At least 62 more villages were attacked, according to sources from the Hema community spoken to by VICE News. The UN puts that number as high as 120.\n\n“Congo is a place where you see violence all too often, but this spate of violence in Djugu was highly unusual even for Congo’s standards,” HRW’s Sawyer told me. “The violence started with incredible speed and seemed, for many in the region, to come out of nowhere.”\n\nAgain and again, Hema refugees and IDPs from Ituri told me even though bad blood may have lingered from past conflicts with the Lendu, both communities had spent the last decade living side by side in relative peace, sharing the same marketplaces and intermarrying. For about six months, tensions rose and rumors of impending violence spread, but they were still shocked when neighbors became murderers overnight.\n\n“This is not an ethnic conflict,” Jean-Marie Ndjaza Linde, the vice-president of the Lendu community’s cultural association, told me in early March, as massacres were still occurring on a daily basis. “This war is not our war. This has been imposed on us by an invisible hand. Ngabu Kaparri Jean-Pierre, a Lendu and a deputy MP in the region from 2006-2011, told me that there might be “a plan to make the two tribes fight.”\n\nThe president of the Hema community’s cultural association, Hadji Ruhingwa Bamaraki, said the same. “There is no conflict between the two communities. We don’t understand why we’ve been attacked,” he explained. Bamaraki likewise raised the specter of unseen forces. “Who is behind this? This is well-organized disorder.”\n\nDozens of witnesses told me they watched local police and soldiers armed with assault rifles run from attackers wielding only machetes and bows and arrows.\n\nLieutenant Jules Ngongo, the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) spokesman in Ituri, categorically denied these claims. Cowardice, he said, was punishable by 20 years in prison.\n\nBut it wasn’t until later in February, when the government deployed soldiers and police from other regions, that the FARDC began carrying out missions targeting the roving bands of attackers in rural Djugu. Even then, according to a United Nations report, Congolese security forces intervened in only 10 of 70 reported attacks in Ituri between February and mid-March.\n\nNews of the massacres spread quickly as survivors streamed out of the countryside. It didn’t take long for reports to reach Pierre Claver Bedidjo, a local MP and ethnic Alur from Djugu. Throughout February, he sat at home in Bunia, the provincial capital, agonizing over the situation. Whole villages were burned to the ground, whole families slaughtered — just dozens of miles away — and yet officials in Kinshasa, the governor of Ituri, and the security forces seemed to be doing little or nothing.\n\nBedidjo had lived through Ituri’s ethnic bloodbath nearly two decades before, and the prospect of another was too much to bear. In a fit of rage, he started typing up letters, an S.O.S. that he hoped would spur the powerful to act. Bedidjo sent each by courier to the offices of officials he believed could save the people of Djugu. His letters were even covered by local media.\n\nNo one would be able to say that they didn’t know exactly what was happening.\n\n“As the blood runs in the Djugu territory, I see myself obligated to come and seize you. In fact, it’s been exactly a week that your delegation has stayed in Ituri, a bloody week for the population of the Djugu territory,” he wrote in a March 12 missive to Henry Mova Sakanyi, the DRC’s vice prime minister and minister of the interior and security. “In your presence, we registered the attack of more villages, including Sala, Lonyo, Deli, Lutsu, Saikpa, Lodza, Nyamamba, Café, Jina, Loga, etc.” The region was fast becoming a charnel house. “It is time to act and for the public power to impose peace, whatever the price,” he pleaded.\n\nBedidjo’s fury grew as he punched the keys a day later. “You stayed cloistered for many days in your magnificent air-conditioned office, while outside, the blood ran and ran in a flood,” he chastised Jefferson Abdallah Penembaka, the governor of the province. “You will agree with us, excellence, that there is no time to lose, because each day that passes bring more fires and more deaths,” he concluded. “Do not forget, excellence, that the population of Djugu and of Ituri will judge you for the way that you will protect them during this difficult time.”\n\n(I reached out to Sakanyi and Penembaka multiple times about Bedidjo’s letters, but neither responded.)\n\nOn March 15, fed up by the silence of Congolese officials, Bedidjo appealed to the local head of MONUSCO, the U.N. peacekeeping mission. “As you know, the territory of Djugu is in flames and blood for nearly three months. Killings, the burning of homes, pillaging, and the massive displacement of people, those are the macabre everyday spectacles,” he began. Warning of humanitarian catastrophe and the possibility of famine, he implored the mission to act. “Because, if we are not careful, this territory — perhaps even the entire Ituri province — risks being in flames.”\n\n“As you know, the territory of Djugu is in flames and blood for nearly three months. Killings, the burning of homes, pillaging and the massive displacement of people, those are the macabre everyday spectacles.”\nIt’s hard to overstate just how important MONUSCO is to the region, especially given the weaknesses of the Congolese military and local police forces, and how frequently they’re implicated in abuses. A recent study by researchers from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, for example, found that MONUSCO bases in Congo dramatically lowered violence in nearby regions. Fewer civilians, they discovered, were killed in areas protected by U.N. troops.\n\nBut MONUSCO was hampered by funding cuts in the months before violence broke out and the peacekeeping mission was forced to shutter bases in Ituri.\n\nThe party most responsible for MONUSCO’s cost-cutting measures? The United States.\n\nIn 2017, Nikki Haley, President Trump’s new ambassador to the U.N., pushed for and won major reductions in funding for peacekeeping troops, including MONUSCO. Afterward, Haley hailed the cuts as a harbinger of what to expect from the new administration. “We have an obligation to the American people to show value in the use of their taxpayer dollars,” she said. “Just five months into our time here, we’ve already been able to cut over half a billion dollars from the U.N. peacekeeping budget, and we’re only getting started.” VICE News repeatedly reached out to Haley’s office for comment; ultimately a spokesperson said, “We don’t have anything additional to add to her public remarks.”\n\nLong before the effects were felt in Ituri, a 2017 report published by the International Peace Institute warned that Haley’s gambit “tipped perilously toward cost-cutting as an end in itself, rather than reflecting a clear vision for a more effective mission, or a more peaceful DRC.” An even more detailed report by the Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC), published in January, warned there might be “significant gaps in protection for civilians in conflict-affected areas.”\n\nThat same month, Ituri exploded in violence.\n\nDavid Gressly, the U.N.’s deputy special rapporteur for DRC, said slashing the budget with little notice made the 2017 cuts particularly damaging. “It cost us the equivalent of one battalion of peacekeepers,” he said. “We’re forced to cover a larger area with fewer troops, and we’ve also had to pull out of a number of bases.”\n\nThe State Department repeatedly failed to answer my questions about whether its cutbacks hampered MONUSCO’s response to the Ituri violence, and instead provided tepid talking points about U.S. support for the mission. MONUSCO, dependent on U.S. aid dollars, largely ignored such questions, although spokesperson Florence Marchal did admit that “the closure of bases affected MONUSCO’s response time earlier this year.”\n\nLauren Spink, CIVIC’s peacekeeping adviser and the author of the 2018 report, echoed Gressly’s and Marchal’s assessments. “In areas where MONUSCO has been forced to pull out, armed groups are becoming more active and there are attacks taking place that might have been discouraged by MONUSCO's presence,” she said.\n\nIn the wake of the massacres, U.N. peacekeepers set up 12 short-lived “standing combat deployment” bases and five temporary military bases in Djugu. But Spink warned that a “temporary MONUSCO presence in these areas may not be enough to protect communities.”\n\nWhen it comes to Africa, the MONUSCO budget cuts are part of a larger pattern of neglect by the Trump administration. The president may dispute the report that he referred to African nations as \"shithole\" countries, but Trump’s policies and funding cuts speak for themselves. On President Trump’s watch, the U.S. has left 14 African nations without an ambassadorship, including the DRC. In August 2017, the administration announced plans to eliminate the position of the U.S. Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the duties were folded into another official’s portfolio). Most leadership positions in the State Department’s Bureau of African Affairs are now staffed by personnel in “acting” capacities — placeholders without much authority. The administration even aimed to slash funding for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) by about 25 percent.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.\n\nIn DRC, aid dollars tell the story. Ten years ago, when the Humanitarian Response Plan for Congo was funded at 83 percent of the request, the United States was, by far, the top donor. At an April 2018 international fundraising conference, in the wake of the Ituri massacres, the U.S. was only the third most generous contributor, pledging 40 percent less to Congo than it had a decade earlier.\n\nOverall, international humanitarian aid to DRC continues to slip, from $84 per person targeted for assistance in 2015 to $61.50 in 2017. Last year’s appeal for Congo was 59 percent funded, meaning that more than 40 percent of the assistance needed — $331 million — was never donated.\n\n“If you look at last year’s totals, per person targeted, Democratic Republic of Congo received $62. If you look at Syria, it was $305 per person targeted,” explained Kimberly Bennett of the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the few international aid groups with a conspicuous presence in Ituri during the crisis.” Obviously, costs are different between countries, but how do you explain that disparity?”\n\nBy the beginning of this year, inadequate donations meant deepening disaster. Jean-Philippe Chauzy, the head of the U.N. migration agency’s mission to the DRC, announced in January, “The humanitarian situation in the DRC is at a breaking point, as is our capacity to respond.” An estimate of the total need — with a focus on the 2017 trouble spots in the Kasai region, the Kivus, and Tanganyika, but not Ituri — already totaled $1.7 billion.\n\nBut the effort to properly fund a humanitarian response in Congo was hampered by Kinshasa’s desperation to project an image of stability to foreign investors and multinational business interests. “The government takes issue with how organizers have characterized the situation in the country in such a way that deliberately tarnishes the country's image,” presidential adviser Patrick Nkanga said of the fundraising effort. The deputy minister for international cooperation, Freddy Kita, expressed similar sentiments to the New York Times in April, insisting that there was “no humanitarian crisis” in Congo and that calls for assistance were part of a “demonization campaign.”\n\n“The number of people in need in Congo is the exact same as those in need in Syria. But people don’t care about Congo.”\nIn the end, DRC boycotted its own aid conference in April. Most of the attendees might as well have, too. About $528 million — less than one-third of the estimated need — was pledged by just 22 of the more than 55 countries and regional organizations in attendance. By late last month, the Democratic Republic of Congo held the dubious distinction of being one of the five least-funded humanitarian response plans of 2018, far behind crisis zones like Yemen and Iraq.\n\n“It’s a huge disappointment,” Alexandra Lamarche, an expert on sub-Saharan Africa with Refugees International, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., told me. “The number of people in need in Congo is the exact same as those in need in Syria. But people don’t care about Congo,” Lamarche said.\n\n\nCHAPTER 3: NO REFUGE\nThey came by foot and truck and motorbike desperate and tired, crowding into villages and towns on the edge of Ituri’s sprawling countryside.\n\nIn early February, refugees swamped the General Hospital compound in Bunia and spilled into a nearby field that became the town’s first IDP camp. Hundreds of exiles were soon living in makeshift hovels built on top of each other. By late May, 10,722 people shared that postage stamp–sized plot of land.\n\n“Here, it’s like we’re pretending to live.”\nHumanitarian organizations had outlined a $9 million aid package in February to address Bunia’s needs, but it almost immediately proved insufficient. At the General Hospital, Ignace Bingi, 58, a pastor and an official with the AIDS League of Ituri, a local NGO better known as LASI, said he needed about 1,200 pounds of rice, 660 pounds of beans, and 10.5 gallons of oil per day to provide just one hot meal to each person at the camp. He was constantly on the cusp of running out of food.\n\n“We’re always hungry here,” said Lisinga Gerare, a 57-year-old father of five who fled an attack on the village of Songamaya and now lived in the camp in a tent so small he couldn’t even straighten his legs to sleep.\n\nMore from this project\nLearn about how we reported this story\nRead the survivors in their own words\n“You stand in a line all morning to get porridge. All evening, you stand in a line to get rice and beans,” he said. “There’s no meat, no fish, no fufu,” the pan-African staple of cassava dough. “Here, it’s like we’re pretending to live.”\n\nThat was in February, when camp residents could still count on eating two meals a day. By April, they were receiving only one — if that. By then, another IDP camp had opened across town and the number of displaced persons registered in Bunia stood at 128,235.\n\n“Tonight, some of them may not get food,” Bingi told me early that month, while standing near the noxious latrines perched on a rise above the camp. “In our stockroom, we’re left mostly with flour.” He had exhausted all funds to pay people to keep the camp clean, to cook food, and to provide security.\n\n“We’re not paying them. God will provide,” he told me, then paused and looked to the sky, before adding, “We hope.”\n\nCut off by the roving bands of attackers, many had no choice but to flee east, away from Bunia and across the border that lies in Lake Albert, Africa’s fifth-largest body of water. It cost most people their life savings, or sometimes more — between 10,000 and 40,000 Congolese francs ($6 and $25) — for a voyage in a rickety wooden fishing boat or canoe to Uganda, perhaps the most stable country in the region.\n\n“Boats are overloaded. They become stranded. They lose their way. They run out of fuel,” said Tam Daniel Roger, the UNHCR field officer at Sebagoro, the primary landing site as we spoke one overcast morning in March.\n\nSome never make it. On February 11, four refugees drowned attempting the trip across the lake. A local official, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, said that three of the dead were children, ages 3, 9, and 12.\n\nStill, Congolese arrived by the dozens, then the hundreds, then the thousands.\n\nTo cope with the influx, international aid workers were redeployed from northern Uganda to the Lake Albert area, where they were already coping with another humanitarian catastrophe in the region, South Sudan’s civil war and the more than 1 million refugees of that conflict. Soon, roadways were teeming with white Toyota Landcruisers sporting the acronyms — UNHCR, MSF, LWF, MTI, AIRD, FRC, IOM, WFP, ICRC — that, together, spell out “crisis-in-progress.” Despite the far larger NGO presence compared to that in the DRC, the new humanitarian emergency taxed the capacity of aid workers to respond.\n\nThen came the outbreak. On February 15, an elderly man was vomiting and suffering fever and acute watery diarrhea when he arrived at Sebagoro. That same day, two children under the age of 5, suffering the same symptoms, died at a refugee camp in Kyangwali. By the end of March, 2,022 cholera cases were reported at Kyangwali and at another refugee camp at Kyaka. An additional 76,000 people at Kyangwali, alone, were soon at risk of contracting the disease.\n\nOvercrowding at Kyangwali’s Kagoma reception center, located 30 miles from Sebagoro — about two hours by road on a dry day — further complicated matters. Thousands were forced to sleep out in the open, exposed to the rainy season’s downpours and “appalling” sanitation conditions.\n\nIn February, to cope with the steady stream of refugees arriving on Lake Albert’s shores, officials opened another Kyangwali settlement area, called Maratatu. But for weeks the amount of drinking water available proved insufficient to supply refugees even at emergency levels. In March, a nutrition screening of 1,321 younger children at Maratatu by Medical Teams International (MTI), an Oregon-based international aid organization, found children were malnourished beyond emergency standards.\n\nThe rolling grasslands of the sprawling Maratatu settlement appeared dotted with thousands of tiny igloos. At one of these wood, bamboo, and grass huts, covered in white plastic sheets branded with UNHCR’s logo, I met two young orphans, Baraka Locorio and Baraka Losa. Their father had died years ago, and their mother just weeks earlier when their village of Tara was attacked by Lendu militiamen.\n\n“There’s not enough food here. We don’t know when or where the distribution is,” said Locorio. “All we’ve gotten is soap, a jerry can, and the plastic sheet,” explained Baraka Losa, gesturing toward their vinyl-sheathed hovel. “We have enough water,” his brother, Baraka Locorio, told me. “But our biggest cha",

Cette semaine supplémentaire lui a permis de peaufiner l'accueil du public, en mettant au point un protocole sanitaire encore plus strict que pour la réouverture l'année dernière. \n\nMalgré les annonces du gouvernement ce mercredi, le port du masque reste obligatoire dès 6 ans partout dans le parc : dans les files d'attente, les boutiques, les hôtels, les restaurants et dans les wagons des attractions.

Moscow’s authorities have decided to rescind self-isolation rules, travel permits and walking schedules starting on June 9, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote on his blog on Monday.\n\n\"Self-isolation rules and travel permits will be waived tomorrow, on June 9, 2020. There will also be no more walking schedules,\" he said.\n\nAll Moscow residents, including those over the age of 65 and people with chronic illnesses, will be able to freely travel around the city and visit public places.\n\nHairdressing salons, veterinary clinics and personnel recruitment agencies are to reopen. The same applies to the offices of non-governmental organizations and cemeteries. Restrictions will be lifted from car sharing services. Film and sound recording studios and research centers will resume normal operation. Theaters, concert halls and circuses will be able to conduct rehearsals.\n\nIn a week’s time, starting from June 16, dentist clinics, companies in the real estate segment, leasing, law, accounting, consulting, advertising and market research will get back to normal activity. It will be possible to hold sports competitions on the condition that the seat occupancy rate will be no greater than 10%.\n\nSummer cafes, libraries, museums, exhibition halls and zoos will be able to reopen provided they observe restrictions on the number of visitors at a time.\n\nDuring the third phase, starting on June 23, gyms, fitness clubs and swimming pools will be allowed to open alongside restaurants, cafes, canteens, bars, and other public catering outlets, spa salons, sunrooms, steam baths and saunas.\n\n\"All reopening organizations will be obliged to comply with the requirements of supervisory authorities and the consumer rights watchdog. The decision concerning the remaining restrictions will be taken later,\" the news release says.\n\n‘Self-protection’ rules\nMoscow residents will have to keep the ‘self-protection’ rules after the lifting of coronavirus-related restrictions, Sobyanin wrote on his blog on Monday, warning that the risk of being infected remains and the battle against the novel coronavirus has not ended in the city.\n\n\"Each of us still has to abide by the self-protection rules, and care for the people around us. Meanwhile the enterprises that have reopened must strictly abide by the requirements of the sanitary services,\" the mayor stressed.\n\nEarlier, Sobyanin specified that these rules implied compulsory facemasks and the social distancing of one-and-a-half meter.\n\nPossible changes\nDates for lifting the coronavirus lockdowns in Moscow may be subject to changes depending on the epidemiological situation in the city, as follows from the mayor’s decree released on Monday. \"Dates for lifting the restrictions may be changed depending on the current epidemiological situation,\" the document reads.\n\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia’s hardest hit area, Moscow, grew by 2,001 in the past 24 hours, to 197,018 people overall. The daily growth rate has been hovering at around 1% in the past week. As many as 1,633 patients recovered in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall number of recoveries to 104,347. Fifty-one patients died, which is the lowest figure in the past two weeks. Overall, 2,970 people have died in Moscow, or 1.51% of all cases.\n\nMoscow declared a high alert over the coronavirus on March 29. All residents were told to self-isolate, while numerous shops, eating establishments, parks, gyms and other facilities were closed. However, the city’s authorities have recently begun to ease restrictions as the coronavirus situation is improving. On May 12, construction businesses were allowed to reopen. The second phase of easing restrictions began on June 1, when some public services reopened and people were allowed out for walks based on a rotation system. However, wearing of protective masks and gloves in public remains mandatory.",

    "content": "Chang’e-5 promises new lunar science as well as more ambitious future missions\nHELSINKI — China has recovered precious lunar samples after a successful reentry and landing of the Chang’e-5 return capsule. \n\nThe roughly 300-kilogram Chang’e-5 return capsule performed a ballistic skip reentry at 12:33 p.m. Eastern Dec. 16, effectively bouncing off the atmosphere over the Arabian Sea before reentry.\n\nThe capsule containing around 2 kilograms of drilled and scooped lunar material landed in the grasslands of Siziwang Banner at 12:59 p.m. Recovery vehicles located the capsule shortly after.\n\nThe recovery ends the space segment of the 23-day Chang’e-5 mission which aimed to collect rock samples thought to be billions of years younger than so far delivered by the U.S. Apollo and Soviet Luna missions. \n\nWhile the samples will be delivered to a specially constructed laboratory in Beijing for preparation, analysis and storage, Chang’e-5 opens doors for further exploration.\n\nThe verification of technologies for liftoff from the lunar surface and automated rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit open the way for planned sample-return missions to near Earth asteroids and Mars in the coming decade, as well as crewed lunar landings in the 2030s. \n\nChang’e-6, a backup mission, will now be repurposed for a landing at the lunar South Pole or South Pole-Aitken Basin. The mission will involve contributions from CNES of France.\n\nThe Chang’e-5 orbiter performed a burn following separation of the return capsule to avoid reentering the atmosphere. The orbiter could now be used for an extended mission, utilizing imagers on the spacecraft.\n\nLunar science pay dirt\nChang’e-5 landed near Mons Rümker in Oceanus Procellarum Dec.1 and collected 0.5 kilograms of samples by drilling up to two meters into the lunar regolith as well as scooping material from the surface. Crater counting from orbital observations indicates the area sampled could be young in geological terms.\n\nVerification of the age of the samples would confirm ideas that some areas of the moon experienced late-stage volcanism, and compositional analysis could provide insights into the reasons behind it. \n\nKatherine Joy, a Reader in Earth Sciences at the University of Manchester says the samples might represent some of the last lunar lava flows to have erupted. “If so, they not only tell us about how the Moon’s thermal history but these are also vital samples to help us calibrate the Moon’s impact history.” \n\nJoy states that calibrating this young part of the Moon’s impact record would have “important implications for understanding the surface ages of all other bodies in the Solar System.”  \n\nJessica Flahaut, a planetary geologist at the University of Lorraine, France, says the mission is”so great for the science community, who has been waiting to get more samples from decades—the last sample return being Luna 24 in 1976—that the Moon is getting more attention again.”\n\nFlahaut notes that the the drilled samples, consisting of 0.5 kilograms of the material will provide further windows on en we will have a record of paleo-regolith layers in the drill core samples, and we could use those to survey the record of the solar winds and galactic events over millions of years.”\n\n“Remote sensing data from the last decades have also shown a number of curiosities, including felsic domes, irregular mare patches, and rock types at the lunar surface, which we don’t have in the sample collection yet. It is therefore key to insist that lunar exploration is still only at its beginning, and that there is much more to do.”\n\nNew phase of lunar and planetary exploration\nChang’e-5 launched Nov. 23, entering lunar orbit 112 hours later. Sampling followed in the hours after a Dec. 1 landing, with an ascent vehicle delivering the collected material into lunar orbit. \n\nAn unprecedented automated lunar orbit rendezvous and docking with the mission service module two days later allowed the transfer of the 2 kilograms of material into the return capsule. \n\nThe mission was China’s most complex so far in terms of robotic space exploration. Initially envisioned as the third of three steps to orbit, land on and sample the moon, Chang’e-5 and the previous successful Chang’e missions give way to an expanded lunar exploration program. \n\nThe extended phase of lunar exploration involves the Chang’e-7 and 8 lunar landing missions in the coming years. The aim will be to establish an ‘international lunar research station’ in the mid-to-late 2020s as a precursor to crewed landings.\n\nSample return technology and experience developed through Chang’e-5 is also to be utilized for planned near Earth asteroid and Mars sample return missions later in the decade. The complexity of the Chang’e-5 mission profile is considered by observers to be related to future crewed lunar landing ambitions.",

    "content": "Anthony Ferrante had just arrived for work at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next door to the White House, when the first attack hit. Around 7 a.m., internet service went out across the United States and parts of Europe. Reddit, Netflix, and The New York Times website wouldn’t load. Ferrante couldn’t check Twitter for updates because that was down too. “No one knew what it was,” he says. “It was definitely chaotic.”\n\nIt was Friday, October 21st, 2016. In two weeks, Americans would pick a new president. When Ferrante, a director in the White House’s cybersecurity team, realized the internet had gone dark across the country, he feared the worst. Ferrante thought he was witnessing a dry run for an attack on the election.\n\nA native of Portland, Maine, with pale Nordic features and a sharp widow’s peak, Ferrante hacked his first computer when he was 10 and studied computer science at Fordham. He was destined for a cushy career as a cyber expert in the private sector when the September 11th attacks happened. He quit corporate America, joined the FBI, and specialized in tracking terrorists on the internet; in his first case at the bureau, he helped foil the terrorist plot to blow up the PATH train tunnel between New York and New Jersey. Over the next decade, he rose to become one of the FBI’s top cyber-security agents and helped write President Obama’s directive that created the first chain of command in the event of a major cyberattack on U.S. soil.In late 2015, Ferrante moved to the White House to run the National Security Council’s Cyber Incident Response Desk, a small team whose job was to lead the government’s response to a major cyberattack. But by the summer of 2016, his focus had narrowed to a single but growing threat: Russian interference in the election. He and his colleagues had received intelligence reports about strange activity targeting state election websites. At first, the details were sketchy and there wasn’t enough data to draw any connections. Then, in July, the head of elections for Illinois noticed a huge amount of data flowing out of his voter registration system. The FBI discovered that Illinois had been hacked; the culprits accessed databases with information on hundreds of thousands of voters and stole an unknown quantity of data.\n\nThe FBI sent an urgent alert to state election chiefs, encouraging them to search their systems for any digital breadcrumbs that matched data from the Illinois breach. Ferrante came to work each morning to find that several new states had been targeted with the same sorts of tools and techniques that Illinois had experienced. With the FBI’s help, his team concluded that Russian-based hackers had penetrated two state voter databases (Illinois was one, the other was not publicly named) and scanned election websites in every state. “We knew at that point we were dealing with a large-scale coordinated campaign,” Ferrante says.\n\nPresident Obama wanted a national cybersecurity preparedness plan for the upcoming election, and Ferrante was put in charge of creating it. He and his team spent months researching every detail of American elections and running different scenarios. What if a million people showed up to vote in Florida only to be told there was no record of them as a voter? What if a cyberattack took down the division of the Associated Press that supplies election-night reporting data to major news organizations like CNN? What if the internet crashed on Election Day?That last scenario felt a lot less hypothetical on October 21st as Ferrante scrambled to figure out why the huge swaths of the internet were dark. He called his counterparts at the FBI, CIA, Department of Homeland Security, and National Security Agency; they were just as confused as he was. By midday the outage was international news, spreading from the East Coast to the West. It was only after the third wave of attacks, Ferrante says, that the FBI made contact with an internet-domain company in New Hampshire called Dyn. The company eventually shored up its servers that day, and the internet was restored.\n\nFerrante and his team had by that point conducted perhaps the most exhaustive study of the potential threats to our convoluted voting system. There were the cyberthreats they had envisioned and prepared for: hacked voter registration databases, disruptions to the flow of information on election night, faulty voter equipment. By Election Day, these threats weren’t all speculative: Two teams of Russian hackers, known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, had broken into the Democratic National Committee and stolen reams of data. The Dyn attack, resulting from a massive botnet that exploited flaws in internet-connected gadgets and appliances such as home security cameras and WiFi routers, showed it was possible to wreak havoc on the internet itself. (To this day, the culprit of that attack remains unknown. The FBI hasn’t announced any arrests and won’t comment on its investigation.)\n\nFor Election Day, Ferrante created the first-ever cybercommand post in the White House Situation Room. From six in the morning until the election was called for Donald Trump, he and his colleagues monitored the vote, but the day passed without incident. The sense of accomplishment he felt was outweighed by a sinking feeling over what he knew Russia had already done. By hacking the Democratic Party, spreading disinformation on social media, and compromising confidential voter data, it had proved to the rest of the world it was possible to successfully interfere in a U.S. election and come away largely unscathed.\n\nObama hit Russia with new sanctions and expelled 35 of its diplomats in his final days in office, but it would be up to his successor to protect against future election attacks. Soon after Trump took office, a team of cyber experts who worked in the Obama White House met with a group of Trump aides including Joshua Steinman, a cybersecurity aide to the new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. (Steinman is now the cybersecurity adviser to the president.) According to people familiar with the meeting, when the Obama staffers told Steinman they wanted to talk about Russian interference, they were met with a blank stare.Nothing happened, was Steinman’s reply: Russia didn’t interfere in the election.\n\nThe Obama team was stunned. Inside the Trump White House, the election security issue “was taboo,” says Andy Grotto, an Obama-era holdover who wrote Trump’s 2017 cybersecurity executive order. Grotto got calls from intelligence agencies asking if they were still allowed to work with their European counterparts on interference issues. (The Trump White House didn’t respond to a request for comment for this story.) Ferrante had seen enough. Three months into Trump’s presidency, he handed in his resignation.Four years ago, for an embarrassingly modest price, Russia pulled off one of the more audacious acts of election interference in modern history. The Internet Research Agency, the team of Kremlin-backed online propagandists, spent $15 million to $20 million and wreaked havoc on the psyche of the American voter, creating the impression that behind every Twitter avatar or Facebook profile was a Russian troll. Russian intelligence agents carried out the digital version of Watergate, infiltrating the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, stealing tens of thousands of emails, and weaponizing them in the days and weeks before the election. Russian-based hackers tested election websites in all 50 states for weak spots, like burglars casing a would-be target. “The Russians were testing whether our windows were open, rattling our doors to see whether they were locked, and found the windows and doors wide open,” says Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. “The fact that they didn’t interject themselves more dramatically into our election was, I think, almost luck.”\n\nDid Russia’s hack-and-leak operation and disinformation blitz tip the election to Trump? Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania, argues in her book Cyberwar that Russia helped Trump win, but the debate over that question rages on to this day. What’s not in doubt, however, is how unprepared and vulnerable the U.S. was.\n\nWe can’t say we weren’t warned. European allies raised the alarm for years about Russian aggression and cyberattacks in Estonia and Ukraine on internet infrastructure, election-reporting systems, and the power grid. In the spring of 2015, a panel of experts testified before Congress about “Confronting Russia’s Weaponization of Information.” One of the witnesses was Peter Pomerantsev, a propaganda expert who experienced President Vladimir Putin’s war on truth and reality from the inside as a Russian TV producer. In the post-Soviet global order, Pomerantsev explained, Russia’s leaders knew they couldn’t compete militarily or economically with the West, so they needed “revolutionary powers and asymmetric responses,” as one Kremlin official put it. Russia’s mastery of propaganda dated back to Stalin, but under Putin’s leadership, the country adapted these tactics for the digital era. It would wage an information war on Western democracies. “We always ask, ‘What does Putin want?’” Pomerantsev testified. “He sees the 21st century that is going to be like this — endless subversion, disinformation, economic manipulation — and he might be right.” He went on, “This is permanent war.”Any member of Congress who heeded Pomerantsev’s warning would have seen Russia’s 2016 interference coming. But only five or six out of 44 lawmakers attended the hearing. C-SPAN didn’t bother to show it.\n\nWe were, in other words, caught with our pants down. Four years later, the Russians are more crafty than ever. According to recent reports, they’re now using encrypted communications and recently hacked the Ukrainian natural-gas company at the center of the Trump impeachment scandal to potentially find damaging material about the Biden family. Other foreign nations, including Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and China, are getting in on the act. They’ll be joined, analysts say, by domestic actors — American consultants and candidates and click merchants borrowing and adapting Russia’s tactics to influence an election or make a quick buck. “The most important piece that I tell everybody,” Ferrante says, “is now that it’s been done once, everybody can do it.”\n\nAre we prepared going into the 2020 election? After seven months of reporting, interviewing more than 40 experts as well as current and former government officials and reviewing thousands of pages of records, the reality is this: We’ve made progress since the last election — but we’re much less secure than we should be. To use Sen. Warner’s analogy, the windows and doors are no longer wide open, but the burglars are more sophisticated, and there are a lot more of them than there were four years ago. They may try to break into our voting systems; they may push online propaganda to merely create the impression of an attack as a way to undermine our faith in the electoral process. “The target is the minds of the American people,” says Joshua Geltzer, a former counterterrorism director on the National Security Council. “In some ways, we’re less vulnerable than we were in 2016. In other ways, it’s more.”\n\nNearly every expert agrees on this: The worst-case scenario, the one we need to prepare for, is a situation that causes Americans to question the bedrock of our democracy — free and fair elections. If such a catastrophe occurred and the integrity of a national election came into doubt, Michael Daniel, the former cybersecurity coordinator in the Obama White House who now runs the Cyber Threat Alliance, isn’t sure the country would ever be the same. “How do we deal with that?” he asks. “How do we recover from that?”Each morning, Kammi Foote gets in her car and begins her 40-minute commute to the front line of an invisible war. Foote lives and works in Inyo County, a vast expanse of eastern California snug along the Nevada border, home to the lowest point in the continental U.S. and the highest, with the hottest recorded temperature in the nation and some of the coldest. There are as many square miles — 10,000 — as there are voters.\n\nIn a small county like Foote’s, local public officials tend to wear many hats. As Inyo County’s clerk recorder and registrar of voters, Foote issues birth and death certificates, officiates 50 or so weddings a year, and oversees elections. Voting is like a religion in her family. As soon as she turned 18, she got her voter registration card and volunteered as a poll worker. Her parents used to call her every Election Day to make sure she’d voted; when she got elected in 2010, her family couldn’t have been prouder. Running the election was now her job.\n\nShe realized that her job was about to change in a dramatic way when an FBI agent contacted her in the fall of 2016. The agent asked Foote if she’d seen anything suspicious related to the upcoming election. Was something about to happen, she wondered. Were her local elections under attack? When she asked for more details, the agent wouldn’t confirm anything. Even if there were an issue, he said, he couldn’t share that information because it was classified. Foote’s first call with the FBI left her more confused than ever.Inyo County is one of roughly 8,000 jurisdictions in the country that administer elections. The distributive and localized design of the American system has long been seen as an asset: There is no central database or voting system to attack, no uniform set of voting software or polling-place equipment. Someone planning a widespread attack on U.S. election infrastructure would, in theory, have their work cut out for them.\n\nThe 2016 election flipped that logic on its head. The possible compromise of a few counties in a razor-thin race was enough to create doubt, if not inflict real damage, on voters’ perception of the election — and in the age of social media and the instantaneous flow of information, perception was reality. Classified documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Reality Winner revealed that Russian hackers tried to do just that, targeting a voting software company called VR Systems and local government offices right before the election. Today, thousands of county and state election offices are prime targets that need protection. “People will say the way we vote is so distributed and diverse and that makes it more resilient,” says Ferrante, the former FBI cybersecurity expert. “But it also introduces a lot of risk and creates a much larger attack surface.”\n\nWhat makes things complicated is that the federal government traditionally leaves the running of elections to states and municipalities. When the Obama administration considered designating voting equipment as critical infrastructure, like power plants, dams, and highways, in the fall of 2016, a small but vocal group of state and local election officials saw a federal takeover in the works and resisted. A few months later, Brian Kemp, a Trump ally who was then Georgia’s secretary of state and governor-elect, accused DHS of trying to hack into his state’s voter registration database. (This was false.) Not until January 2017, in the final days of Obama’s presidency and after the intelligence community published its conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, did state officials agree to a critical infrastructure designation. Congress soon passed a bill to create the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at DHS to help county clerks and secretaries of state protect election infrastructure. “We went from an environment in 2017 and the beginning of 2018 where quite literally states are accusing the Department of Homeland Security of trying to hack them to having relationships with all 50 states,” says Matt Masterson, a DHS cyber-security adviser.\n\nExperts who study election systems in the U.S. say many flaws remain. Some counties and states still use outdated voting equipment and insecure election software: At the 2018 DEFCON hacker conference, an 11-year-old hacked into a copycat version of Florida’s state election website and changed vote totals in less than 10 minutes. Only three states conduct mandatory, scientifically rigorous post-election audits to ensure the final vote count is accurate. “We’re still in a situation going into 2020 where there are significant gaps left in the security of election infrastructure,” says J. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan computer science professor who studies voting equipment. “Until we ensure that all of the doors are locked, there will be ample opportunity for foreign adversaries to disrupt or, in the worst-case scenario, change the outcome of close elections.”\n\nAnd the federal government is in no hurry to fill those gaps. As Halderman likes to say, there are more federal guidelines and requirements on whiskey and plastic bottles than voting equipment. While Congress has funded nearly $900 million in election security in the past two years, it let states spend the money however they pleased. “We would never say to our power grid companies, ‘We’re not going to have any rules of the road at all — you just self-regulate,’” Sen. Warner says. “Money without some requisites means states could print bigger ‘I Voted’ stickers instead of actually improving their systems. That’s a huge error.”Local election officials like Kammi Foote find themselves thrust into a global battle without borders, clear enemies, or rules of engagement, a daily struggle to protect the integrity of elections and to reassure Americans their democracy is safe. Foote’s relationship with the feds has dramatically improved since the FBI first called in late 2016. Inyo County is now part of an information-sharing network backed by DHS that pushes out technical alerts. Foote says she and her team receive intel about new threats almost every day. Twenty-four hours after a U.S. drone strike killed Iran’s top military general in early January, DHS briefed election officials on potential retaliatory cyberattacks by Iran. Another DHS tool, called an Albert sensor, alerts her IT team to malware attacks. Foote knows who to call at the FBI or DHS if an attack happens.\n\nFoote says she’s never felt more prepared for protecting her small slice of the vote in November. But she also recognizes there’s only so much she can do. The number of personnel in her office hasn’t grown since the mid-Nineties, and the local board of supervisors recently denied her request for an additional election staffer dedicated to cybersecurity. She worries about ransomware, a form of attack employed by hackers to infiltrate a network and lock out users from their computers or phones until they pay to regain access. A December 2019 confidential alert by the FBI obtained by Rolling Stone said reports of an especially vicious type of ransom-ware attacking municipalities, called Ryuk, had recently spiked by 400 percent. Foote says she’s troubled about what would happen if a ransomware attack happened during an election and interfered with her ability to do her job.\n\n“I’m the person who’s supposed to be defending against these nation-state actors,” she says. “It’s not that we’re not up to the task. But there are certain things we are unable to defend against. When someone has unlimited resources, they have unlimited power to try to find vulnerabilities in the system.”\n\nOn the eve of the 2018 midterm elections, a strange website appeared out of nowhere with an ominous message. Claiming to be the American division of the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-backed disinformation factory, the site said the IRA had thousands of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit accounts pushing propaganda as well as “allies and spoilers” embedded in various campaigns. The website then posted a list of all Senate races and said the outcome was already decided well before all votes had been cast. It also published a spreadsheet that listed dozens of social media accounts that were supposedly part of the IRA’s campaign to disrupt the midterms. There were obvious errors in the list of “rigged” elections — Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who had announced his retirement, was listed as winning — but the social media accounts looked real, from Jordan Peterson fan pages to Instagram accounts named “Redneck Army” and “Proud to Be Black.”The point of all this, it seemed, was to cast fresh doubt on the midterms. “We control the voting and counting systems,” the supposed IRA statement read. “We are choosing for you.”\n\nOnly it didn’t work. By the time the list of social media accounts was released, most of the accounts were inactive. Acting on a tip from the FBI a few days before the election, Facebook had investigated and removed the suspicious accounts.\n\nHeading into the 2016 election, the major tech companies either pretended the disinformation problem didn’t exist or that there was nothing they could do about it. Foreign influence operations ran wild. An infamous example was the IRA-run Twitter account @TEN_GOP, which was apparently registered to a Russian cellphone number. “It was the Wild West,” says Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a social media analysis firm. “Across the major platforms, they had very broad latitude to get away with stuff.” Mark Zuckerberg denied Facebook had a Russian interference problem even after the election — until his company did its due diligence and Zuckerberg was hauled before Congress and apologized.\n\n“In 2016, we missed the threat and weren’t ready,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s director of cybersecurity policy, tells me during an hourlong interview at the company’s sprawling D.C. office. Gleicher joined Facebook in early 2018 and built a team to combat disinformation that numbers several dozen people worldwide. Facebook’s new rules have led to a dramatic increase in the number of takedowns — from one in 2017 to more than 50 in 2019. By the midterms, the three biggest social media platforms — Facebook, Twitter, and Google, which owns YouTube — had created internal teams devoted to rooting out disinformation and influence operations. Gleicher mentions the “IRA in the USA” takedown as an example of the level of cooperation between government and tech companies that didn’t exist four years ago. “That is a really good sign of how things have changed,” he says.\n\nYet in the ways they’ve chosen to police their platforms, the tech companies have left plenty of openings for disinformation to spread. In Facebook’s case, Gleicher says the company has chosen to root out bad actors — whether they’re Russian trolls, e-criminals from Iran, or clickbait profiteers here in the U.S. — not by the content they post but the behavior of the people running the accounts. The company looks for what it calls “inauthentic behavior,” which includes creating fake accounts, masking the true identity of the person or group operating a Facebook page, and using a network of pages in close coordination to game Facebook’s algorithm and reach a larger audience. “We have articulated a set of behaviors that are deceptive, that mislead users, and that violate our policies,” Gleicher says. “At its core, it doesn’t matter who’s doing it. It doesn’t matter what content they’re sharing. It doesn’t matter what they believe or don’t believe.”But that position relieves Facebook from any obligation to police much of the content that appears on its platform. (The company has strict policies for hate speech, terrorist propaganda, and other dangerous material.) And Congress has yet to act, despite lawmakers offering a slew of proposals to regulate social media companies and rein in disinformation, foreign and domestic. One proposed solution is treating social media companies like TV stations, with the same rigorous transparency rules. Another would make tech companies liable for certain types of content published on their platforms. Right now, Facebook is under no such obligation to remove a misleading ad or meme if it doesn’t violate the company’s behavior-centric guidelines.\n\nFacebook’s critics call this a cop-out, and the company’s announcement last year that it would not fact-check ads by elected officials and political candidates even if they contained blatant lies only fueled that criticism. These critics say the company is afraid of angering conservatives who are quick to cry censorship (despite no evidence to back them up) while putting the billions to be made in political advertising over protecting truth in civil discourse. “It’s very commercially convenient to take the position that Mark Zuckerberg took,” says Dipayan Ghosh, a former privacy and public-policy adviser at Facebook who assisted the Obama White House with tech policy. “It allows him to keep conservatives on his side, and he gets a lot of money from digital advertising. They’re going to do everything they can to claim that.”\n\nOn December 19th, @TrumpWarRoom, a rapid-response account run by President Trump’s re-election campaign, sent an explosive tweet. According to @TrumpWarRoom, James Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, had called for hanging the president on live TV. The pro-Trump echo chamber and amplification machine sprang into action. Fox News contributors, right-wing social media celebrities, and presidential allies shared the tweet, reaching an audience of millions. In reality, Clyburn had merely compared Mitch McConnell’s pledge to work in lockstep with Trump during a Senate impeachment trial with a hypothetical rigged trial and hanging. Every fact checker who reviewed the tweet — which is still up — rated it false.How do you defend against disinformation when the president of the United States spews lies and retweets conspiracy theorists? How can you deter election interference by foreign nations when the commander in chief has invited other countries to intervene in our elections? “There’s a counterintelligence threat coming from inside the White House,” Joshua Geltzer, the former National Security Council lawyer, says. “How do you guard against that?”\n\nDonald Trump got elected with the help of foreign interference — meddling he invited — as well as domestic and foreign disinformation. (“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”) He dismisses talk of Russia’s election interference as an attack on his legitimacy. His senior aides have reportedly declared discussion of election security to be off-limits in the Oval Office. The National Security Council cut the position of cybersecurity coordinator. The White House’s chief of computer network defense — a position created after Russian hackers penetrated the White House’s network in 2014 — resigned last fall and sent a scathing memo that described a “hostile” and humiliating work environment for cybersecurity staffers. Most recently, the head of DHS’s young cybersecurity division left for a job at Google. One expert describes the wave of departures as “the systematic decimation of the personnel” tasked with protecting the administration and the vote in 2020.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to any government-wide strategy to defend our elections is the current occupant of the White House. Trump’s refusal to consider the issue has led to a logjam in the Senate, where McConnell, in lockstep with the president, refuses to allow a vote on bipartisan bills that would require transparency by tech companies on advertising spending and make paper backup ballots mandatory in elections. Still, Trump hasn’t managed to prevent various agencies — FBI, DHS, NSA, and so on — from taking their slice of the issue. “I’ve been surprised at how much we’ve been able to accomplish in spite of that,” says one elections expert who has advised state and federal governments and requested anonymity to speak about Trump. “Maybe where we’re at in year four is where we could’ve been at year two and a half.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the agencies are on the same page in addressing the threat. And if any threat to national security required a unified strategy set by the commander in chief, it would be election interference. “If your only problem is somebody is robbing banks, the FBI can probably take it,” says David Kris, a former assistant attorney general for national security at the Justice Department. “This effort is cross-cutting, requires the whole of government and whole of nation, and you can’t get the whole of government aligned and moving downfield in formation unless you’ve got strong leadership from the White House.” Instead, he adds, “we’ve got a commander in chief who is at best highly ambivalent and at worst actively courting its return in 2020.”\n\nExperts interviewed by Rolling Stone say a 2020 attack might look something this: Malware hits voter-registration databases in Ohio, Florida, and Michigan, altering the addresses of thousands of people and causing chaos at polling stations across the country. Some affected by the breach vote by provisional ballots, but those backup ballots soon run out, and thousands of frustrated voters give up and go home without voting. Then a tweet appears purporting to show a local Democratic official bragging about rigging the vote to oust Trump from office. The tweet goes viral. Soon, the president tweets that Democrats “rigged” the election and the result can’t be trusted.\n\nThis may sound far-fetched. But it isn’t all that different from the things Trump said in the waning days of 2016. He said the election was “being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media” and “also at many polling places.” He refused to say if he’d accept the final election result. Even after he won, he promoted a bogus conspiracy about “millions and millions” of illegal votes cast in states like California. If his second term hangs in the balance, and there’s even the faintest whiff of controversy, is there any doubt what Trump would do to stay in power?\n\nKris, the assistant attorney general who now runs the consulting firm Culper Partners, says this scenario in particular keeps him up at night. He can easily imagine Trump and his allies challenging county-level vote totals across the country and refusing to concede. “He simply says, ‘I’m not leaving. I didn’t lose, it was rigged, and you can see that we have literally 78 lawsuits going in 78 different counties and states challenging the result,’” Kris says. “It makes Bush v. Gore look like a nursery school exercise.”",

    "content": "The ongoing trade and political dispute between South Korea and Japan is tied to lingering wounds dating back more than 100 years.\n\nHowever, as the countries are two of the world's largest economies and giants in technology, the tit-for-tat dispute also has global implications.\n\nAt the centre is South Korea's demands that Japan pay what they consider to be appropriate reparations for atrocities committed during the Japanese occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, particularly the use of forced labour.\n\nBut Japan considers the issue to be settled.\n\nSo what exactly is going on?\n\nWhat's the background to the fight?\nThe two nations share a complicated history. They have fought on and off since at least the 7th Century, and Japan has repeatedly tried to invade the peninsula since then.\n\nIn 1910, it annexed Korea, turning the territory into a colony.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Japan was starting to mobilise for war. It began to force people to work in the factories and mines, or enlist as soldiers.\n\nIt also sent tens of thousands of women from across Asia - many of them Korean - into military brothels to service Japanese soldiers. The victims became known as \"comfort women\".Japan's rule of Korea ended in 1945 when it was defeated in the war. But it took another 20 years before South Korean President Park Chung-hee agreed to normalise relations with the country in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and grants.\n\nTokyo argues that the 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties and provided more than $800m (£620m) in Japanese financial help, has settled the matter.\n\nHowever, it remains far from resolved.\n\nWhy isn't the issue settled?\nYoo Euy-sang, a diplomat and author of the book Diplomatic Propriety & Our Interests With Japan, told the South China Morning Post the row was ongoing for two reasons: one, the 1965 deal did not \"settle all the problems related to our colonial past\", and two, that it \"took away citizens' individual rights to ask for reparations\".\n\nThe issue of \"comfort women\" remained particularly contentious: in 2015, Japan apologised and promised to pay 1bn yen ($9.5m; £7.9m) - the amount South Korea asked for - to fund victims.\n\n\"Japan and South Korea are now entering a new era,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters at the time. \"We should not drag this problem into the next generation.\"But activists say they were not consulted, and rejected the deal. President Moon Jae-in, elected in 2017, suggested it be altered.\n\nThe historic dispute rumbles on, with neither country looking likely to bend.\n\nWhy has it blown up now?\nThe issue reared its head again in 2018, when South Korea's top court ordered a Japanese firm to compensate Koreans it used as forced labour.\n\nMitsubishi Heavy, one of the firms involved, has reportedly refused to comply with the court order, while two other companies have had their assets seized in South Korea.The issue has angered many in South Korea, with people boycotting Japanese goods. One man smashed up his Japanese-made car.\n\nIt's also led to a flare up in tensions over a group of islands claimed by both countries.\n\nThe Japanese government, meanwhile, stuck to its line, saying all reparation issues had been settled by the 1965 treaty.\n\nThen, in August 2019, Japan announced it was going to remove Seoul's favoured trade partner status and imposed export controls on its important electronics sector - vital for South Korean companies like Samsung.\n\nSeoul then announced it had decided to end the country's intelligence-sharing pact because of the decision. It said it caused a \"grave\" change in security co-operation between the two countries.\n\nJapan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono called it a \"complete misjudgement of the current regional security environment\" and said Tokyo would \"strongly protest\" to Seoul about it. There has been no response yet from Washington, which had pushed for the pact three years ago, in part to help track North Korea's missile activity.\n\nStock markets slipped amid fears that the trade spat could badly affect electronics around the world.\n\nHowever, there were perhaps signs tensions may be calming in November, when South Korea announced it had decided to continue a military intelligence-sharing pact.",

As firefighters worked to tamp down largely contained blazes, evacuation orders were lifted in all of Los Angeles County and in parts of Riverside County, where a second fire raged.\n\nThe Los Angeles blaze, which officials have named the Saddleridge Fire, ignited late Thursday, destroying more than 30 structures. It began in the northernmost Los Angeles County neighborhood of Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nAs of Saturday night local time, the fire torched more than 7,900 acres and is 33% contained, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti had issued emergency declarations Friday. Newsom said in a statement the state secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency \"to help ensure the availability of resources to fight the Saddleridge Fire.\"\n\nGarcetti, tweeted an image of him signing paperwork that would ensure agencies \"take all the necessary steps to protect lives and property threatened by this fire.\"\n\nAt least 31 structures have been damaged and more property assessments are planned. Of the affected structures, 13 of them were completely destroyed, according to the latest alert by the LAFD.\n\nMore than 1,000 firefighters were assigned to combat the fire, including personnel from the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Fire Department and United States Forest Service.\n\n\"This is a very dynamic fire,\" Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said at a Friday news conference.\n\nStrong Santa Ana winds, coupled with the area's dry chaparral landscape, have helped fuel the fire. The flames have forced the closure of several miles of the 118 and 210 freeways. Officials say the fire started out about 1 acre in size, but soon morphed into a wind-driven fire that \"quickly pushed across Sylmar.\"\n\nEvacuation orders affected communities on both sides of Interstate 5, including neighborhoods like Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, which were also evacuated.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Saturday that wind gusts were weaker than in previous days, but added that \"single digit humidities and warm temperatures will still result in Red Flag Warnings\" across the Los Angeles region.\n\nJacob Margolis of NPR member station KPCC described the scene from a staging area for first responders at Hansen Dam, not far from the fire line.\n\n\"There are bulldozers, trailers,\" Margolis told NPR's Morning Edition on Friday.\n\n\"Really everyone is just trying to coordinate and figure out how to tackle the fires, especially before they creep into the neighborhood. And they've been doing that all night,\" he said.\n\nLocal officials say 276 minors at the Barry J. Nidorf juvenile detention center in Sylmar were evacuated earlier in the day to another facility approximately 40 miles away in Downey.\n\n\"It was done out of an abundance of caution,\" said Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors member Kathryn Barger at an afternoon news conference.\n\nShe also said Olive View Hospital is currently under a shelter-in-place order, but patients at a nearby urgent care center for mental health were evacuated and patients were moved to the main hospital.\n\nEmergency officials say one civilian went into cardiac arrest and died at the hospital, and one firefighter sustained a minor injury to his eye. The officials did not provide details about those cases.\n\nNo cause of the fire has been determined.\n\nTerrazas said emergency officials received the first reports of the fire around 9 p.m. Thursday.Earlier in the week PG&E, the state's largest utility, began proactively shutting off power to roughly 800,000 customers in Northern and Central California, impacting nearly 2.5 million people, according to one estimate.\n\nNPR's Emma Bowman contributed to this report.\n\n\"Our first arriving companies reported significant fire with multiple homes threatened,\" Terrazas said. \"We went into an aggressive offensive attack while simultaneously setting up our structure protection.\"\n\nEast of Los Angeles, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department say what officials are referring to as the Sandalwood Fire was 68% contained at roughly 1,000 acres on Saturday night. Two people have been found dead at the charred site of the blaze at a mobile home park in Calimesa. An evacuation order remains in place at the Villa Calimesa Mobile Home Park, where at least 74 structures have been destroyed.For days, California utility companies have been preemptively cutting off power out of fear that high wind gusts could blow power lines into trees, sparking dangerous fires.\n\nOn Friday, Southern California Edison cut off power to more than 21,000 customers under its Public Safety Power Shutdown in Kern, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. As of Saturday evening, that number was down to 54 customers, according to the utility.\n\nThe fire raised concerns that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Porter Ranch might cause another gas leak like the one that spewed methane into the air in 2015 and 2016. Last year, the company reached a $119.5 million settlement with several government entities over the leak.\n\nOn Friday, SoCalGas tweeted: \"No indications of damage or leaks at the facility.\"",

Beitar Jerusalem is one of Israel's top football clubs. It has won six Israeli Premier League titles, most recently in 2007-8, and counts Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu among its supporters.\n\nHowever, the club is well-known for a group of hardcore \"ultra\" fans, called \"La Familia\", that has been openly racist towards Arabs, who make up 20% of Israel's population. Chants of \"Death to Arabs\" were regularly heard at matches at Teddy Stadium, and the owners were warned not to sign Arab or Muslim players.\n\nIn 2013, the club's offices were set on fire days after it bought in two Chechen Muslim footballers. Two members of La Familia were charged with arson.\n\nBeitar Jerusalem's current owner, Israeli technology entrepreneur Moshe Hogeg, launched an anti-racism campaign after buying the club in 2018.\n\nHe told the BBC last December that he had warned fans: \"You shout one racist comment and I will sue you for a million dollars.\" Despite some opposition from supporters, he signed a deal with Sheikh Hamad on Monday that saw the billionaire member of Abu Dhabi's royal family take a 50% stake in Beitar Jerusalem.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Hogeg said the move - which comes days before Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights - symbolised a \"new and exciting light\".\n\n\"Together, we all march the club to new days of coexistence, achievements and brotherhood for the sake of our club, community and Israeli sports,\" he added.\n\nA historic and exciting day for Beitar Jerusalem. This afternoon (monday) a partnership agreement was signed between Mr. Moshe Hogeg and Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Nahyan >> https://t.co/xJlNJChIGV pic.twitter.com/CPC5f3F1pF\n\n— Beitar Jerusalem FC (@fcbeitar) December 7, 2020 Sheikh Hamad said: \"I am thrilled to be a partner in such a glorious club that I have heard so much of and in such a great city, the capital of Israel and one of the holiest cities in the world.\"\n\nHe added: \"I have heard a lot about the change taking place in the club and the way things are going, and I am happy to take part in that.\"\n\nSheikh Hamad's reference to Jerusalem is potentially controversial, given the city's status is at the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its capital - a position supported only by the Trump administration, Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nThe Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state of their own.\n\nFollowing its deal to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, the UAE said it remained committed to the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.",

    "content": "(CNN)The coronavirus pandemic almost certainly originated from an animal, probably at a wildlife market in China, and not from a laboratory leak, a group of virus experts said Wednesday.\n\nTheories about a lab leak are almost all based on coincidence, not hard evidence, the group of 20 top experts from the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere said.\nThey had been following discussions -- going all the way to the White House -- about the possibility of a laboratory origin of the virus, and worked together to analyze the evidence.\n\"I think you can make a pretty strong argument that it didn't leak from a lab,\" Robert Garry, professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane Medical School and one of the scientists who signed the paper, told CNN.\nThe experts lay out the published evidence in a pre-print review posted online.It is signed by some of the leading experts in coronaviruses and the genetics of viruses, including Kristian Andersen of The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California; evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona; Andrew Rambaut of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Edinburgh; Stephen Goldstein of the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Utah; Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan; Joel Wertheim of the University of California, San Diego; and Jeremy Farrar of Britain's Wellcome Trust.\nMany have done their own investigations into the possible origin of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.\n\"We contend that there is substantial body of scientific evidence supporting a zoonotic (animal) origin for SARS-CoV-2,\" they wrote.\n\"There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has a laboratory origin. There is no evidence that any early cases had any connection to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), in contrast to the clear epidemiological links to animal markets in Wuhan, nor evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology possessed or worked on a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 prior to the pandemic,\" they added.\"The suspicion that SARS-CoV-2 might have a laboratory origin stems from the coincidence that it was first detected in a city that houses a major virological laboratory that studies coronaviruses.\"\nBut it's not a surprise that a new virus might emerge in Wuhan, they noted.\n\"Wuhan is the largest city in central China with multiple animal markets and is a major hub for travel and commerce, well connected to other areas both within China and internationally,\" they wrote.\"The link to Wuhan therefore more likely reflects the fact that pathogens often require heavily populated areas to become established.\"\nGarry and colleagues also say it is \"extremely unlikely\" that the lab was working on a virus of natural origin that accidentally leaked out. \"You have to have an unlikely set of circumstances in place for something like that to happen. If it was a person at the lab, then how did it get to all the animal markets?\" Garry asked. \"There are other, much more likely ways that this virus got into the human population. Just like SARS 1, it happened the same way with SARS 2.\"What did get lost was some of the valuable evidence that disappeared when the animal markets in the area were cleared and sanitized, Garry said. \"They shut down farms. They cleaned those animals out of that market,\" he said. Samples from the Huanan Seafood Market and others did turn up evidence of the virus, the experts said, but the animals that might have been infected and that could have provided the needed smoking gun were removed.\n\"We'd like to know more. We wish the Chinese government was a little bit more open about the wildlife trade,\" Garry said.\nThe World Health Organization has been leading efforts to find the origins of the coronavirus and issued a report in March saying it was most likely the virus originated in an animal and passed to people, as other coronaviruses have. Least likely, it said, is the possibility that a virus was engineered in a lab and leaked out.\nMuch of the investigation has focused on early cases at Wuhan's Huanan Seafood market.But WHO has been criticized for accepting evidence from China, and the administration of President Joe Biden has been taking another look at the origins.\nIt's not the first joint letter from scientists fed up with speculation. On Monday, in another letter to the Lancet, a group of scientists called for reason and science in the investigation.\n\"Careful and transparent collection of scientific information is essential to understand how the virus has spread and to develop strategies to mitigate the ongoing impact of COVID-19, whether it occurred wholly within nature or might somehow have reached the community via an alternative route, and prevent future pandemics,\" they wrote.\n\"Allegations and conjecture are of no help, as they do not facilitate access to information and objective assessment of the pathway from a bat virus to a human pathogen that might help to prevent a future pandemic.\"",
